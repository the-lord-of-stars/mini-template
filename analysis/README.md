# Author Collaboration Network Visualization

This project provides an interactive D3.js force layout visualization of author collaboration networks from visualization research papers (2015-2024).

## Files

- `author_collaboration_network.html` - Main visualization file
- `process_collaboration_data.py` - Python script to process and analyze the data
- `filtered_dataset.csv` - Input dataset with paper information
- `collaboration_network_data.json` - Processed data for visualization (generated by Python script)

## Features

### Interactive Network Visualization
- **Force-directed layout** using D3.js v7
- **Node representation**: Each node represents an author
  - Size indicates number of papers authored
  - Color indicates primary conference (InfoVis, VAST, Vis, SciVis)
  - Hover for detailed information
- **Link representation**: Each link represents a collaboration
  - Thickness indicates number of collaborative papers
  - Hover for collaboration details

### Interactive Features
- **Drag nodes** to reposition them
- **Click nodes** to highlight their connections
- **Hover over nodes/links** for detailed tooltips
- **Filter controls** to explore different subsets:
  - Minimum papers per author
  - Minimum citations per author
  - Year range (2015-2024)
  - Conference selection
- **Real-time statistics** showing network metrics
- **Export functionality** to save filtered data

### Network Analysis
The Python script provides comprehensive network analysis including:
- Network density and clustering coefficients
- Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- Top authors by various metrics
- Conference distribution analysis
- Collaboration patterns

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open `author_collaboration_network.html` in a web browser
2. The visualization will automatically load and display the collaboration network
3. Use the filter controls to explore different aspects of the network
4. Interact with nodes and links to discover collaboration patterns

### Data Processing (Optional)
If you want to regenerate the processed data or analyze the network:

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install pandas networkx matplotlib seaborn

# Run the data processing script
python process_collaboration_data.py
```

This will:
- Process the CSV data and extract collaboration relationships
- Calculate network metrics and centrality measures
- Generate a summary report of the analysis
- Create `collaboration_network_data.json` for the visualization

## Data Structure

### Input CSV Format
The `filtered_dataset.csv` should contain:
- `Conference`: Conference name (InfoVis, VAST, Vis, SciVis)
- `Year`: Publication year
- `Title`: Paper title
- `DOI`: Digital Object Identifier
- `AuthorNames-Deduped`: Semicolon-separated list of authors
- `AminerCitationCount`: Citation count

### Network Data Format
The processed JSON contains:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "Author Name",
      "name": "Author Name",
      "paperCount": 5,
      "totalCitations": 150,
      "conferences": ["InfoVis", "VAST"],
      "collaboratorCount": 12,
      "primaryConference": "InfoVis",
      "degreeCentrality": 0.15,
      "betweennessCentrality": 0.08,
      "closenessCentrality": 0.25
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "Author 1",
      "target": "Author 2",
      "weight": 3,
      "paperCount": 3,
      "conferences": ["InfoVis"],
      "years": [2018, 2019, 2020]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalNodes": 500,
    "totalLinks": 1200,
    "networkMetrics": {
      "density": 0.012,
      "averageClustering": 0.45,
      "numberOfComponents": 15,
      "largestComponentSize": 300
    }
  }
}
```

## Network Metrics Explained

### Centrality Measures
- **Degree Centrality**: Number of direct connections (collaborators)
- **Betweenness Centrality**: How often an author lies on shortest paths between other authors
- **Closeness Centrality**: Average distance to all other authors in the network

### Network Properties
- **Density**: Ratio of actual connections to possible connections
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Tendency of authors to form tightly connected groups
- **Components**: Number of disconnected sub-networks
- **Largest Component**: Size of the main connected network

## Visualization Controls

### Filter Options
- **Min Papers**: Show only authors with at least N papers
- **Min Citations**: Show only authors with at least N total citations
- **Year Range**: Filter papers by publication year
- **Conference**: Filter by specific conference

### Interaction Modes
- **Pan**: Click and drag on empty space
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or pinch gestures
- **Select**: Click on nodes to highlight connections
- **Explore**: Hover for detailed information

## Browser Compatibility

The visualization works best in modern browsers:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Performance Notes

- Large networks (>1000 nodes) may require some time to load
- Use filters to reduce network size for better performance
- The force simulation automatically adjusts for optimal performance

## Customization

### Styling
Modify the CSS in the HTML file to customize:
- Color scheme
- Node and link appearance
- Layout and typography
- Responsive design

### Functionality
Extend the JavaScript to add:
- Additional filter options
- New interaction modes
- Custom metrics and analysis
- Export formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Data not loading**: Ensure `filtered_dataset.csv` is in the same directory
2. **Slow performance**: Use filters to reduce network size
3. **Display issues**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **Missing features**: Ensure you're using a modern browser

### Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools (F12) to see:
- Data loading progress
- Network metrics and statistics
- Error messages and warnings

## Contributing

To extend the visualization:
1. Modify the HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI changes
2. Update the Python script for new analysis features
3. Test with different datasets and network sizes
4. Document new features and usage patterns
