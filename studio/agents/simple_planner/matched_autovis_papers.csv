Voyager: Exploratory Analysis via Faceted Browsing of Visualization Recommendations,2015,InfoVis,292.0,"['recommendation', 'mixed-initiative']","General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views: analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and visual encodings to apply. These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering."
Quality Metrics in High-Dimensional Data Visualization: An Overview and Systematization,2011,InfoVis,188.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this paper, we present a systematization of techniques that use quality metrics to help in the visual exploration of meaningful patterns in high-dimensional data. In a number of recent papers, different quality metrics are proposed to automate the demanding search through large spaces of alternative visualizations (e.g., alternative projections or ordering), allowing the user to concentrate on the most promising visualizations suggested by the quality metrics. Over the last decade, this approach has witnessed a remarkable development but few reflections exist on how these methods are related to each other and how the approach can be developed further. For this purpose, we provide an overview of approaches that use quality metrics in high-dimensional data visualization and propose a systematization based on a thorough literature review. We carefully analyze the papers and derive a set of factors for discriminating the quality metrics, visualization techniques, and the process itself. The process is described through a reworked version of the well-known information visualization pipeline. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by applying it to several existing approaches that use quality metrics, and we provide reflections on implications of our model for future research."
A Design Space of Visualization Tasks,2013,InfoVis,144.0,['recommendation'],"Knowledge about visualization tasks plays an important role in choosing or building suitable visual representations to pursue them. Yet, tasks are a multi-faceted concept and it is thus not surprising that the many existing task taxonomies and models all describe different aspects of tasks, depending on what these task descriptions aim to capture. This results in a clear need to bring these different aspects together under the common hood of a general design space of visualization tasks, which we propose in this paper. Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research. To this end, we propose interfaces to our design space for different user roles (developers, authors, and end users) that allow users of different levels of expertise to work with it."
Augmenting Visualizations with Interactive Data Facts to Facilitate Interpretation and Communication,2018,InfoVis,121.0,"['recommendation', 'mixed-initiative']","Recently, an increasing number of visualization systems have begun to incorporate natural language generation (NLG) capabilities into their interfaces. NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools. Participant feedback suggested that interactive data facts aided them in interpreting visualizations. Participants also stated that the suggestions surfaced through the facts helped them explore alternative visualizations and embellishments to communicate individual data facts."
Seq2Seq-Vis: A Visual Debugging Tool for Sequence-to-Sequence Models,2018,VAST,120.0,['pipeline automation'],"Neural sequence-to-sequence models have proven to be accurate and robust for many sequence prediction tasks, and have become the standard approach for automatic translation of text. The models work with a five-stage blackbox pipeline that begins with encoding a source sequence to a vector space and then decoding out to a new target sequence. This process is now standard, but like many deep learning methods remains quite difficult to understand or debug. In this work, we present a visual analysis tool that allows interaction and “what if”-style exploration of trained sequence-to-sequence models through each stage of the translation process. The aim is to identify which patterns have been learned, to detect model errors, and to probe the model with counterfactual scenario. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through several real-world sequence-to-sequence use cases on large-scale models."
Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization,2011,InfoVis,109.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing bundled layouts of general graphs. As layout cues for bundles, we use medial axes, or skeletons, of edges which are similar in terms of position information. We combine edge clustering, distance fields, and 2D skeletonization to construct progressively bundled layouts for general graphs by iteratively attracting edges towards the centerlines of level sets of their distance fields. Apart from clustering, our entire pipeline is image-based with an efficient implementation in graphics hardware. Besides speed and implementation simplicity, our method allows explicit control of the emphasis on structure of the bundled layout, i.e. the creation of strongly branching (organic-like) or smooth bundles. We demonstrate our method on several large real-world graphs."
An Interaction Model for Visualizations Beyond The Desktop,2013,InfoVis,107.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present an interaction model for beyond-desktop visualizations that combines the visualization reference model with the instrumental interaction paradigm. Beyond-desktop visualizations involve a wide range of emerging technologies such as wall-sized displays, 3D and shape-changing displays, touch and tangible input, and physical information visualizations. While these technologies allow for new forms of interaction, they are often studied in isolation. New conceptual models are needed to build a coherent picture of what has been done and what is possible. We describe a modified pipeline model where raw data is processed into a visualization and then rendered into the physical world. Users can explore or change data by directly manipulating visualizations or through the use of instruments. Interactions can also take place in the physical world outside the visualization system, such as when using locomotion to inspect a large scale visualization. Through case studies we illustrate how this model can be used to describe both conventional and unconventional interactive visualization systems, and compare different design alternatives."
FAIRVIS: Visual Analytics for Discovering Intersectional Bias in Machine Learning,2019,VAST,106.0,['mixed-initiative'],"The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people. Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS's coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems."
explAIner: A Visual Analytics Framework for Interactive and Explainable Machine Learning,2019,VAST,96.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a framework for interactive and explainable machine learning that enables users to (1) understand machine learning models; (2) diagnose model limitations using different explainable AI methods; as well as (3) refine and optimize the models. Our framework combines an iterative XAI pipeline with eight global monitoring and steering mechanisms, including quality monitoring, provenance tracking, model comparison, and trust building. To operationalize the framework, we present explAIner, a visual analytics system for interactive and explainable machine learning that instantiates all phases of the suggested pipeline within the commonly used TensorBoard environment. We performed a user-study with nine participants across different expertise levels to examine their perception of our workflow and to collect suggestions to fill the gap between our system and framework. The evaluation confirms that our tightly integrated system leads to an informed machine learning process while disclosing opportunities for further extensions."
Finding Waldo: Learning about Users from their Interactions,2014,VAST,95.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Visual analytics is inherently a collaboration between human and computer. However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed-initiative visual analytics systems."
DQNViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Deep Q-Networks,2018,VAST,91.0,['agents'],"Deep Q-Network (DQN), as one type of deep reinforcement learning model, targets to train an intelligent agent that acquires optimal actions while interacting with an environment. The model is well known for its ability to surpass professional human players across many Atari 2600 games. Despite the superhuman performance, in-depth understanding of the model and interpreting the sophisticated behaviors of the DQN agent remain to be challenging tasks, due to the long-time model training process and the large number of experiences dynamically generated by the agent. In this work, we propose DQNViz, a visual analytics system to expose details of the blind training process in four levels, and enable users to dive into the large experience space of the agent for comprehensive analysis. As an initial attempt in visualizing DQN models, our work focuses more on Atari games with a simple action space, most notably the Breakout game. From our visual analytics of the agent's experiences, we extract useful action/reward patterns that help to interpret the model and control the training. Through multiple case studies conducted together with deep learning experts, we demonstrate that DQNViz can effectively help domain experts to understand, diagnose, and potentially improve DQN models."
Saliency-guided Enhancement for Volume Visualization,2006,Vis,88.0,['pipeline automation'],"Recent research in visual saliency has established a computational measure of perceptual importance. In this paper we present a visual-saliency-based operator to enhance selected regions of a volume. We show how we use such an operator on a user-specified saliency field to compute an emphasis field. We further discuss how the emphasis field can be integrated into the visualization pipeline through its modifications of regional luminance and chrominance. Finally, we validate our work using an eye-tracking-based user study and show that our new saliency enhancement operator is more effective at eliciting viewer attention than the traditional Gaussian enhancement operator"
Patterns and Sequences: Interactive Exploration of Clickstreams to Understand Common Visitor Paths,2016,VAST,86.0,['pipeline automation'],"Modern web clickstream data consists of long, high-dimensional sequences of multivariate events, making it difficult to analyze. Following the overarching principle that the visual interface should provide information about the dataset at multiple levels of granularity and allow users to easily navigate across these levels, we identify four levels of granularity in clickstream analysis: patterns, segments, sequences and events. We present an analytic pipeline consisting of three stages: pattern mining, pattern pruning and coordinated exploration between patterns and sequences. Based on this approach, we discuss properties of maximal sequential patterns, propose methods to reduce the number of patterns and describe design considerations for visualizing the extracted sequential patterns and the corresponding raw sequences. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through an analysis scenario and discuss the strengths and limitations of the methods based on user feedback."
Lark: Coordinating Co-located Collaboration with Information Visualization,2009,InfoVis,84.0,['pipeline automation'],"Large multi-touch displays are expanding the possibilities of multiple-coordinated views by allowing multiple people to interact with data in concert or independently. We present Lark, a system that facilitates the coordination of interactions with information visualizations on shared digital workspaces. We focus on supporting this coordination according to four main criteria: scoped interaction, temporal flexibility, spatial flexibility, and changing collaboration styles. These are achieved by integrating a representation of the information visualization pipeline into the shared workspace, thus explicitly indicating coordination points on data, representation, presentation, and view levels. This integrated meta-visualization supports both the awareness of how views are linked and the freedom to work in concert or independently. Lark incorporates these four main criteria into a coherent visualization collaboration interaction environment by providing direct visual and algorithmic support for the coordination of data analysis actions over shared large displays."
DataShot: Automatic Generation of Fact Sheets from Tabular Data,2019,InfoVis,83.0,['pipeline automation'],"Fact sheets with vivid graphical design and intriguing statistical insights are prevalent for presenting raw data. They help audiences understand data-related facts effectively and make a deep impression. However, designing a fact sheet requires both data and design expertise and is a laborious and time-consuming process. One needs to not only understand the data in depth but also produce intricate graphical representations. To assist in the design process, we present DataShot which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated system that creates fact sheets automatically from tabular data. First, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 245 infographic examples to explore general infographic design space at both the sheet and element levels. We identify common infographic structures, sheet layouts, fact types, and visualization styles during the study. Based on these findings, we propose a fact sheet generation pipeline, consisting of fact extraction, fact composition, and presentation synthesis, for the auto-generation workflow. To validate our system, we present use cases with three real-world datasets. We conduct an in-lab user study to understand the usage of our system. Our evaluation results show that DataShot can efficiently generate satisfactory fact sheets to support further customization and data presentation."
Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree: Interactive Subspace Visual Exploration and Analysis of High Dimensional Data,2013,InfoVis,80.0,['pipeline automation'],"For high-dimensional data, this work proposes two novel visual exploration methods to gain insights into the data aspect and the dimension aspect of the data. The first is a Dimension Projection Matrix, as an extension of a scatterplot matrix. In the matrix, each row or column represents a group of dimensions, and each cell shows a dimension projection (such as MDS) of the data with the corresponding dimensions. The second is a Dimension Projection Tree, where every node is either a dimension projection plot or a Dimension Projection Matrix. Nodes are connected with links and each child node in the tree covers a subset of the parent node's dimensions or a subset of the parent node's data items. While the tree nodes visualize the subspaces of dimensions or subsets of the data items under exploration, the matrix nodes enable cross-comparison between different combinations of subspaces. Both Dimension Projection Matrix and Dimension Project Tree can be constructed algorithmically through automation, or manually through user interaction. Our implementation enables interactions such as drilling down to explore different levels of the data, merging or splitting the subspaces to adjust the matrix, and applying brushing to select data clusters. Our method enables simultaneously exploring data correlation and dimension correlation for data with high dimensions."
VIS4ML: An Ontology for Visual Analytics Assisted Machine Learning,2018,VAST,74.0,['pipeline automation'],"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely “VA-assisted ML”. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly."
"Warning, Bias May Occur: A Proposed Approach to Detecting Cognitive Bias in Interactive Visual Analytics",2017,VAST,70.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Visual analytic tools combine the complementary strengths of humans and machines in human-in-the-loop systems. Humans provide invaluable domain expertise and sensemaking capabilities to this discourse with analytic models; however, little consideration has yet been given to the ways inherent human biases might shape the visual analytic process. In this paper, we establish a conceptual framework for considering bias assessment through human-in-the-loop systems and lay the theoretical foundations for bias measurement. We propose six preliminary metrics to systematically detect and quantify bias from user interactions and demonstrate how the metrics might be implemented in an existing visual analytic system, InterAxis. We discuss how our proposed metrics could be used by visual analytic systems to mitigate the negative effects of cognitive biases by making users aware of biased processes throughout their analyses."
KG4Vis: A Knowledge Graph-Based Approach for Visualization Recommendation,2021,Vis,69.0,"['recommendation', 'generation']","Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective data visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data visualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
VisTrails: enabling interactive multiple-view visualizations,2005,Vis,68.0,['pipeline automation'],"VisTrails is a new system that enables interactive multiple-view visualizations by simplifying the creation and maintenance of visualization pipelines, and by optimizing their execution. It provides a general infrastructure that can be combined with existing visualization systems and libraries. A key component of VisTrails is the visualization trail (vistrail), a formal specification of a pipeline. Unlike existing dataflow-based systems, in VisTrails there is a clear separation between the specification of a pipeline and its execution instances. This separation enables powerful scripting capabilities and provides a scalable mechanism for generating a large number of visualizations. VisTrails also leverages the vistrail specification to identify and avoid redundant operations. This optimization is especially useful while exploring multiple visualizations. When variations of the same pipeline need to be executed, substantial speedups can be obtained by caching the results of overlapping subsequences of the pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of VisTrails, and show its effectiveness in different application scenarios."
Full Body Virtual Autopsies using a State-of-the-art Volume Rendering Pipeline,2006,Vis,66.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper presents a procedure for virtual autopsies based on interactive 3D visualizations of large scale, high resolution data from CT-scans of human cadavers. The procedure is described using examples from forensic medicine and the added value and future potential of virtual autopsies is shown from a medical and forensic perspective. Based on the technical demands of the procedure state-of-the-art volume rendering techniques are applied and refined to enable real-time, full body virtual autopsies involving gigabyte sized data on standard GPUs. The techniques applied include transfer function based data reduction using level-of-detail selection and multi-resolution rendering techniques. The paper also describes a data management component for large, out-of-core data sets and an extension to the GPU-based raycaster for efficient dual TF rendering. Detailed benchmarks of the pipeline are presented using data sets from forensic cases"
VisComplete: Automating Suggestions for Visualization Pipelines,2008,Vis,65.0,['pipeline automation'],"Building visualization and analysis pipelines is a large hurdle in the adoption of visualization and workflow systems by domain scientists. In this paper, we propose techniques to help users construct pipelines by consensus-automatically suggesting completions based on a database of previously created pipelines. In particular, we compute correspondences between existing pipeline subgraphs from the database, and use these to predict sets of likely pipeline additions to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in a carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and other data products more efficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggested completions. We present an implementation of our technique in a publicly-available, open-source scientific workflow system and demonstrate efficiency gains in real-world situations."
Video visualization,2003,Vis,59.0,['pipeline automation'],"Video data, generated by the entertainment industry, security and traffic cameras, video conferencing systems, video emails, and so on, is perhaps most time-consuming to process by human beings. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for ""summarizing"" video sequences using volume visualization techniques. We outline a system pipeline for capturing videos, extracting features, volume rendering video and feature data, and creating video visualization. We discuss a collection of image comparison metrics, including the linear dependence detector, for constructing ""relative"" and ""absolute"" difference volumes that represent the magnitude of variation between video frames. We describe the use of a few volume visualization techniques, including volume scene graphs and spatial transfer functions, for creating video visualization. In particular, we present a stream-based technique for processing and directly rendering video data in real time. With the aid of several examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using video visualization to convey meaningful information contained in video sequences."
Optimized geometry compression for real-time rendering,1997,Vis,57.0,['pipeline automation'],"Most existing visualization applications use 3D geometry as their basic rendering primitive. As users demand more complex data sets, the memory requirements for retrieving and storing large 3D models are becoming excessive. In addition, the current 3D rendering hardware is facing a large memory bus bandwidth bottleneck at the processor to graphics pipeline interface. Rendering 1 million triangles with 24 bytes per triangle at 30 Hz requires as much as 720 MB/sec memory bus bandwidth. This transfer rate is well beyond the current low-cost graphics systems. A solution is to compress the static 3D geometry as an off-line pre-process. Then, only the compressed geometry needs to be stored in main memory and sent down to the graphics pipeline for real-time decompression and rendering. The author presents several new techniques for compression of 3D geometry that produce 2 to 3 times better compression ratios than existing methods. They first introduce several algorithms for the efficient encoding of the original geometry as generalized triangle meshes. This encoding allows most of the mesh vertices to be reused when forming new triangles. Their second contribution allows various parts of a geometric model to be compressed with different precision depending on the level of details present. Together, the meshifying algorithms and the variable compression method achieve compression ratios of 30 and 37 to one over ASCII encoded formats and 10 and 15 to one over binary encoded triangle strips. The experimental results show a dramatically lowered memory bandwidth required for real-time visualization of complex data sets."
Composition and Configuration Patterns in Multiple-View Visualizations,2020,InfoVis,57.0,['recommendation'],"Multiple-view visualization (MV) is a layout design technique often employed to help users see a large number of data attributes and values in a single cohesive representation. Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design."
Clustrophile 2: Guided Visual Clustering Analysis,2018,VAST,57.0,['recommendation'],"Data clustering is a common unsupervised learning method frequently used in exploratory data analysis. However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial, requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances. The number of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the large clustering space so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. We introduce Clustrophile 2, a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis. Clustrophile 2 guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings. To this end, Clustrophile 2 contributes a novel feature, the Clustering Tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations. We evaluate Clustrophile 2 through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients. Results suggest that Clustrophile 2 improves the speed and effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis for both experts and non-experts."
Visualization by Demonstration: An Interaction Paradigm for Visual Data Exploration,2016,InfoVis,57.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Although data visualization tools continue to improve, during the data exploration process many of them require users to manually specify visualization techniques, mappings, and parameters. In response, we present the Visualization by Demonstration paradigm, a novel interaction method for visual data exploration. A system which adopts this paradigm allows users to provide visual demonstrations of incremental changes to the visual representation. The system then recommends potential transformations (Visual Representation, Data Mapping, Axes, and View Specification transformations) from the given demonstrations. The user and the system continue to collaborate, incrementally producing more demonstrations and refining the transformations, until the most effective possible visualization is created. As a proof of concept, we present VisExemplar, a mixed-initiative prototype that allows users to explore their data by recommending appropriate transformations in response to the given demonstrations."
Podium: Ranking Data Using Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics,2017,VAST,52.0,['mixed-initiative'],"People often rank and order data points as a vital part of making decisions. Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user's data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user's subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings. Our proposed approach makes powerful machine learning techniques more usable to those who may not have expertise in these areas."
Automatic Transfer Function Generation Using Contour Tree Controlled Residue Flow Model and Color Harmonics,2009,Vis,49.0,['pipeline automation'],"Transfer functions facilitate the volumetric data visualization by assigning optical properties to various data features and scalar values. Automation of transfer function specifications still remains a challenge in volume rendering. This paper presents an approach for automating transfer function generations by utilizing topological attributes derived from the contour tree of a volume. The contour tree acts as a visual index to volume segments, and captures associated topological attributes involved in volumetric data. A residue flow model based on Darcy's law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them. The proposed approach allows efficient automation of transfer function generations, and exploration on the data to be carried out based on controlling of opacity residue flow rate instead of complex low-level transfer function parameter adjustments. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the practical use of our approach in transfer function generations."
Visualization and interaction techniques for the exploration of vascular structures,2001,Vis,48.0,['pipeline automation'],"We describe a pipeline of image processing steps for deriving symbolic models of vascular structures from radiological data which reflect the branching pattern and diameter of vessels. For the visualization of these symbolic models, concatenated truncated cones are smoothly blended at branching points. We put emphasis on the quality of the visualizations which is achieved by anti-aliasing operations in different stages of the visualization. The methods presented are referred to as HQVV (high quality vessel visualization). Scalable techniques are provided to explore vascular structures of different orders of magnitude. The hierarchy as well as the diameter of the branches of vascular systems are used to restrict visualizations to relevant subtrees and to emphasize parts of vascular systems. Our research is inspired by clear visualizations in textbooks and is targeted toward medical education and therapy planning. We describe the application of vessel visualization techniques for liver surgery planning. For this application it is crucial to recognize the morphology and branching pattern of vascular systems as well as the basic spatial relations between vessels and other anatomic structures."
EventAction: Visual analytics for temporal event sequence recommendation,2016,VAST,48.0,['recommendation'],"Recommender systems are being widely used to assist people in making decisions, for example, recommending films to watch or books to buy. Despite its ubiquity, the problem of presenting the recommendations of temporal event sequences has not been studied. We propose EventAction, which to our knowledge, is the first attempt at a prescriptive analytics interface designed to present and explain recommendations of temporal event sequences. EventAction provides a visual analytics approach to (1) identify similar records, (2) explore potential outcomes, (3) review recommended temporal event sequences that might help achieve the users' goals, and (4) interactively assist users as they define a personalized action plan associated with a probability of success. Following the design study framework, we designed and deployed EventAction in the context of student advising and reported on the evaluation with a student review manager and three graduate students."
Feature-Driven Visual Analytics of Soccer Data,2014,VAST,48.0,['pipeline automation'],"Soccer is one the most popular sports today and also very interesting from an scientific point of view. We present a system for analyzing high-frequency position-based soccer data at various levels of detail, allowing to interactively explore and analyze for movement features and game events. Our Visual Analytics method covers single-player, multi-player and event-based analytical views. Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results. We evaluate our approach by investigating real-world soccer matches and collecting additional expert feedback. Several use cases and findings illustrate the capabilities of our approach."
Multi-Model Semantic Interaction for Text Analytics,2014,VAST,47.0,['pipeline automation'],"Semantic interaction offers an intuitive communication mechanism between human users and complex statistical models. By shielding the users from manipulating model parameters, they focus instead on directly manipulating the spatialization, thus remaining in their cognitive zone. However, this technique is not inherently scalable past hundreds of text documents. To remedy this, we present the concept of multi-model semantic interaction, where semantic interactions can be used to steer multiple models at multiple levels of data scale, enabling users to tackle larger data problems. We also present an updated visualization pipeline model for generalized multi-model semantic interaction. To demonstrate multi-model semantic interaction, we introduce StarSPIRE, a visual text analytics prototype that transforms user interactions on documents into both small-scale display layout updates as well as large-scale relevancy-based document selection."
Towards Automated Infographic Design: Deep Learning-based Auto-Extraction of Extensible Timeline,2019,InfoVis,47.0,['pipeline automation'],"Designers need to consider not only perceptual effectiveness but also visual styles when creating an infographic. This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance. The results confirm that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates from real-world timeline infographics."
Interactive Visual Analysis of Perfusion Data,2007,Vis,44.0,['agents'],"Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing."
Fast view-dependent level-of-detail rendering using cached geometry,2002,Vis,43.0,['pipeline automation'],"Level-of-detail rendering is essential for rendering very large, detailed worlds in real-time. Unfortunately, level-of-detail computations can be expensive, creating a bottleneck at the CPU. This paper presents the CABTT algorithm, an extension to existing binary-triangle-tree-based level-of-detail algorithms. Instead of manipulating triangles, the CABTT algorithm instead operates on clusters of geometry called aggregate triangles. This reduces CPU overhead, eliminating a bottleneck common to level-of-detail algorithms. Since aggregate triangles stay fixed over several frames, they may be cached on the video card. This further reduces CPU load and fully utilizes the hardware accelerated rendering pipeline on modern video cards. These improvements result in a fourfold increase in frame rate over ROAM at high detail levels. Our implementation renders an approximation of an 8 million triangle height field at 42 frames per second with an maximum error of 1 pixel on consumer hardware."
Visualizing Flow of Uncertainty through Analytical Processes,2012,InfoVis,43.0,['pipeline automation'],"Uncertainty can arise in any stage of a visual analytics process, especially in data-intensive applications with a sequence of data transformations. Additionally, throughout the process of multidimensional, multivariate data analysis, uncertainty due to data transformation and integration may split, merge, increase, or decrease. This dynamic characteristic along with other features of uncertainty pose a great challenge to effective uncertainty-aware visualization. This paper presents a new framework for modeling uncertainty and characterizing the evolution of the uncertainty information through analytical processes. Based on the framework, we have designed a visual metaphor called uncertainty flow to visually and intuitively summarize how uncertainty information propagates over the whole analysis pipeline. Our system allows analysts to interact with and analyze the uncertainty information at different levels of detail. Three experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our design."
Augmenting Sports Videos with VisCommentator,2021,Vis,42.0,['recommendation'],"Visualizing data in sports videos is gaining traction in sports analytics, given its ability to communicate insights and explicate player strategies engagingly. However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level <i>(what the constituents are)</i> and clip-level <i>(how those constituents are organized)</i>. We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by <i>selecting the data</i> to visualize instead of manually <i>drawing the graphical marks</i>. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports <i>(e.g</i>., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities."
A Pipeline for Computer Aided Polyp Detection,2006,Vis,42.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a novel pipeline for computer-aided detection (CAD) of colonic polyps by integrating texture and shape analysis with volume rendering and conformal colon flattening. Using our automatic method, the 3D polyp detection problem is converted into a 2D pattern recognition problem. The colon surface is first segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the patient's abdomen, which is then mapped to a 2D rectangle using conformal mapping. This flattened image is rendered using a direct volume rendering technique with a translucent electronic biopsy transfer function. The polyps are detected by a 2D clustering method on the flattened image. The false positives are further reduced by analyzing the volumetric shape and texture features. Compared with shape based methods, our method is much more efficient without the need of computing curvature and other shape parameters for the whole colon surface. The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view. The proposed automatic CAD pipeline is incorporated into an interactive VC system, with a goal of helping radiologists detect polyps faster and with higher accuracy"
Familiarity Vs Trust: A Comparative Study of Domain Scientists' Trust in Visual Analytics and Conventional Analysis Methods,2016,VAST,41.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Combining interactive visualization with automated analytical methods like statistics and data mining facilitates data-driven discovery. These visual analytic methods are beginning to be instantiated within mixed-initiative systems, where humans and machines collaboratively influence evidence-gathering and decision-making. But an open research question is that, when domain experts analyze their data, can they completely trust the outputs and operations on the machine-side? Visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? To address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. We propose a trust-augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. For evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. We find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. In fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums. We summarize the implications of our findings with directions for future research on trustworthiness of visual analytic systems."
Visual Analytics for Topic Model Optimization based on User-Steerable Speculative Execution,2018,VAST,40.0,['mixed-initiative'],"To effectively assess the potential consequences of human interventions in model-driven analytics systems, we establish the concept of speculative execution as a visual analytics paradigm for creating user-steerable preview mechanisms. This paper presents an explainable, mixed-initiative topic modeling framework that integrates speculative execution into the algorithmic decision-making process. Our approach visualizes the model-space of our novel incremental hierarchical topic modeling algorithm, unveiling its inner-workings. We support the active incorporation of the user's domain knowledge in every step through explicit model manipulation interactions. In addition, users can initialize the model with expected topic seeds, the backbone priors. For a more targeted optimization, the modeling process automatically triggers a speculative execution of various optimization strategies, and requests feedback whenever the measured model quality deteriorates. Users compare the proposed optimizations to the current model state and preview their effect on the next model iterations, before applying one of them. This supervised human-in-the-Ioop process targets maximum improvement for minimum feedback and has proven to be effective in three independent studies that confirm topic model quality improvements."
Visual Signatures in Video Visualization,2006,Vis,39.0,['pipeline automation'],"Video visualization is a computation process that extracts meaningful information from original video data sets and conveys the extracted information to users in appropriate visual representations. This paper presents a broad treatment of the subject, following a typical research pipeline involving concept formulation, system development, a path-finding user study, and a field trial with real application data. In particular, we have conducted a fundamental study on the visualization of motion events in videos. We have, for the first time, deployed flow visualization techniques in video visualization. We have compared the effectiveness of different abstract visual representations of videos. We have conducted a user study to examine whether users are able to learn to recognize visual signatures of motions, and to assist in the evaluation of different visualization techniques. We have applied our understanding and the developed techniques to a set of application video clips. Our study has demonstrated that video visualization is both technically feasible and cost-effective. It has provided the first set of evidence confirming that ordinary users can be accustomed to the visual features depicted in video visualizations, and can learn to recognize visual signatures of a variety of motion events"
Visualization in grid computing environments,2004,Vis,37.0,['pipeline automation'],"Grid computing provides a challenge for visualization system designers. In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner. We see dataflow at three levels: an abstract specification of the intent of the visualization; a binding of these abstract modules to a specific software system; and then a binding of software to processing and other resources. We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource. We demonstrate the work in two applications: the dispersion of a pollutant under different wind conditions; and the solution of a challenging numerical problem in elastohydrodynamic lubrication."
FairSight: Visual Analytics for Fairness in Decision Making,2019,VAST,37.0,['pipeline automation'],"Data-driven decision making related to individuals has become increasingly pervasive, but the issue concerning the potential discrimination has been raised by recent studies. In response, researchers have made efforts to propose and implement fairness measures and algorithms, but those efforts have not been translated to the real-world practice of data-driven decision making. As such, there is still an urgent need to create a viable tool to facilitate fair decision making. We propose FairSight, a visual analytic system to address this need; it is designed to achieve different notions of fairness in ranking decisions through identifying the required actions – understanding, measuring, diagnosing and mitigating biases – that together lead to fairer decision making. Through a case study and user study, we demonstrate that the proposed visual analytic and diagnostic modules in the system are effective in understanding the fairness-aware decision pipeline and obtaining more fair outcomes."
PlotThread: Creating Expressive Storyline Visualizations using Reinforcement Learning,2020,InfoVis,36.0,"['mixed-initiative', 'agents']","Storyline visualizations are an effective means to present the evolution of plots and reveal the scenic interactions among characters. However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases."
A Utility-Aware Visual Approach for Anonymizing Multi-Attribute Tabular Data,2017,VAST,36.0,['pipeline automation'],"Sharing data for public usage requires sanitization to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Previous studies have presented methods for creating privacy preserving visualizations. However, few of them provide sufficient feedback to users on how much utility is reduced (or preserved) during such a process. To address this, we design a visual interface along with a data manipulation pipeline that allows users to gauge utility loss while interactively and iteratively handling privacy issues in their data. Widely known and discussed types of privacy models, i.e., syntactic anonymity and differential privacy, are integrated and compared under different use case scenarios. Case study results on a variety of examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Multivariate Data Analysis Using Persistence-Based filtering and Topological Signatures,2012,SciVis,36.0,['pipeline automation'],"The extraction of significant structures in arbitrary high-dimensional data sets is a challenging task. Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features-the persistence intervals-of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities. In addition, we provide interactive visualization techniques that assist the user in evaluating the parameter space of our method in order to extract relevant structures. We describe and evaluate our analysis pipeline by means of two very distinct classes of data sets: First, a class of synthetic data sets containing topological objects is employed to highlight the interaction capabilities of our method. Second, in order to affirm the utility of our technique, we analyse a class of high-dimensional real-world data sets arising from current research in cultural heritage."
IRIS: Illustrative Rendering for Integral Surfaces,2010,Vis,36.0,['pipeline automation'],"Integral surfaces are ideal tools to illustrate vector fields and fluid flow structures. However, these surfaces can be visually complex and exhibit difficult geometric properties, owing to strong stretching, shearing and folding of the flow from which they are derived. Many techniques for non-photorealistic rendering have been presented previously. It is, however, unclear how these techniques can be applied to integral surfaces. In this paper, we examine how transparency and texturing techniques can be used with integral surfaces to convey both shape and directional information. We present a rendering pipeline that combines these techniques aimed at faithfully and accurately representing integral surfaces while improving visualization insight. The presented pipeline is implemented directly on the GPU, providing real-time interaction for all rendering modes, and does not require expensive preprocessing of integral surfaces after computation."
Visualizing 3D velocity fields near contour surfaces,1994,Vis,35.0,['pipeline automation'],"Vector field rendering is difficult in 3D because the vector icons overlap and hide each other. We propose four different techniques for visualizing vector fields only near surfaces. The first uses motion blurred particles in a thickened region around the surface. The second uses a voxel grid to contain integral curves of the vector field. The third uses many antialiased lines through the surface, and the fourth uses hairs sprouting from the surface and then bending in the direction of the vector field. All the methods use the graphics pipeline, allowing real time rotation and interaction, and the first two methods can animate the texture to move in the flow determined by the velocity field.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;"
Click2Annotate: Automated Insight Externalization with rich semantics,2010,VAST,35.0,['pipeline automation'],"Insight Externalization (IE) refers to the process of capturing and recording the semantics of insights in decision making and problem solving. To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented insight browsing and faceted insight search."
Kori: Interactive Synthesis of Text and Charts in Data Documents,2021,Vis,34.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents."
NLIZE: A Perturbation-Driven Visual Interrogation Tool for Analyzing and Interpreting Natural Language Inference Models,2018,InfoVis,34.0,['pipeline automation'],"With the recent advances in deep learning, neural network models have obtained state-of-the-art performances for many linguistic tasks in natural language processing. However, this rapid progress also brings enormous challenges. The opaque nature of a neural network model leads to hard-to-debug-systems and difficult-to-interpret mechanisms. Here, we introduce a visualization system that, through a tight yet flexible integration between visualization elements and the underlying model, allows a user to interrogate the model by perturbing the input, internal state, and prediction while observing changes in other parts of the pipeline. We use the natural language inference problem as an example to illustrate how a perturbation-driven paradigm can help domain experts assess the potential limitation of a model, probe its inner states, and interpret and form hypotheses about fundamental model mechanisms such as attention."
Multi-Focused Geospatial Analysis Using Probes,2008,InfoVis,34.0,['agents'],"Traditional geospatial information visualizations often present views that restrict the user to a single perspective. When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users."
Annotation Graphs: A Graph-Based Visualization for Meta-Analysis of Data Based on User-Authored Annotations,2016,VAST,33.0,['mixed-initiative'],"User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas."
Splatting without the blur,1999,Vis,32.0,['pipeline automation'],"Splatting is a volume rendering algorithm that combines efficient volume projection with a sparse data representation. Only voxels that have values inside the iso-range need to be considered, and these voxels can be projected via efficient rasterization schemes. In splatting, each projected voxel is represented as a radially symmetric interpolation kernel, equivalent to a fuzzy ball. Projecting such a basis function leaves a fuzzy impression, called a footprint or splat, on the screen. Splatting traditionally classifies and shades the voxels prior to projection, and thus each voxel footprint is weighted by the assigned voxel color and opacity. Projecting these fuzzy color balls provides a uniform screen image for homogeneous object regions, but leads to a blurry appearance of object edges. The latter is clearly undesirable, especially when the view is zoomed on the object. In this work, we manipulate the rendering pipeline of splatting by performing the classification and shading process after the voxels have been projected onto the screen. In this way volume contributions outside the iso-range never affect the image. Since shading requires gradients, we not only splat the density volume, using regular splats, but we also project the gradient volume, using gradient splats. However alternative to gradient splats, we can also compute the gradients on the projection plane using central differencing. This latter scheme cuts the number of footprint rasterization by a factor of four since only the voxel densities have to be projected."
PipelineProfiler: A Visual Analytics Tool for the Exploration of AutoML Pipelines,2020,VAST,32.0,['pipeline automation'],"In recent years, a wide variety of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been proposed to generate end-to-end ML pipelines. While these techniques facilitate the creation of models, given their black-box nature, the complexity of the underlying algorithms, and the large number of pipelines they derive, they are difficult for developers to debug. It is also challenging for machine learning experts to select an AutoML system that is well suited for a given problem. In this paper, we present the Pipeline Profiler, an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration and comparison of the solution space of machine learning (ML) pipelines produced by AutoML systems. PipelineProfiler is integrated with Jupyter Notebook and can be combined with common data science tools to enable a rich set of analyses of the ML pipelines, providing users a better understanding of the algorithms that generated them as well as insights into how they can be improved. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through use cases where PipelineProfiler is used to better understand and improve a real-world AutoML system. Furthermore, we validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of a think-aloud experiment with six data scientists who develop and evaluate AutoML tools."
GraphProtector: A Visual Interface for Employing and Assessing Multiple Privacy Preserving Graph Algorithms,2018,VAST,32.0,['pipeline automation'],"Analyzing social networks reveals the relationships between individuals and groups in the data. However, such analysis can also lead to privacy exposure (whether intentionally or inadvertently): leaking the real-world identity of ostensibly anonymous individuals. Most sanitization strategies modify the graph's structure based on hypothesized tactics that an adversary would employ. While combining multiple anonymization schemes provides a more comprehensive privacy protection, deciding the appropriate set of techniques-along with evaluating how applying the strategies will affect the utility of the anonymized results-remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we introduce GraphProtector, a visual interface that guides a user through a privacy preservation pipeline. GraphProtector enables multiple privacy protection schemes which can be simultaneously combined together as a hybrid approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphPro tector, we report several case studies and feedback collected from interviews with expert users in various scenarios."
MultiVision: Designing Analytical Dashboards with Deep Learning Based Recommendation,2021,Vis,31.0,"['recommendation', 'mixed-initiative']","We contribute a deep-learning-based method that assists in designing analytical dashboards for analyzing a data table. Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner. We compare our deep learning model with existing methods for visualization recommendation and conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the system."
Quick-VDR: interactive view-dependent rendering of massive models,2004,Vis,30.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a novel approach for interactive view-dependent rendering of massive models. Our algorithm combines view-dependent simplification, occlusion culling, and out-of-core rendering. We represent the model as a clustered hierarchy of progressive meshes (CHPM). We use the cluster hierarchy for coarse-grained selective refinement and progressive meshes for fine-grained local refinement. We present an out-of-core algorithm for computation of a CHPM that includes cluster decomposition, hierarchy generation, and simplification. We make use of novel cluster dependencies in preprocess to generate crack-free, drastic simplifications at runtime. The clusters are used for occlusion culling and out-of-core rendering. We add a frame of latency to the rendering pipeline to fetch newly visible clusters from the disk and to avoid stalls. The CHPM reduces the refinement cost for view-dependent rendering by more than an order of magnitude as compared to a vertex hierarchy. We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC. We can render massive CAD, isosurface, and scanned models, consisting of tens or a few hundreds of millions of triangles at 10-35 frames per second with little loss in image quality."
Gemini: A Grammar and Recommender System for Animated Transitions in Statistical Graphics,2020,InfoVis,30.0,['recommendation'],"Animated transitions help viewers follow changes between related visualizations. Specifying effective animations demands significant effort: authors must select the elements and properties to animate, provide transition parameters, and coordinate the timing of stages. To facilitate this process, we present Gemini, a declarative grammar and recommendation system for animated transitions between single-view statistical graphics. Gemini specifications define transition “steps” in terms of high-level visual components (marks, axes, legends) and composition rules to synchronize and concatenate steps. With this grammar, Gemini can recommend animation designs to augment and accelerate designers' work. Gemini enumerates staged animation designs for given start and end states, and ranks those designs using a cost function informed by prior perceptual studies. To evaluate Gemini, we conduct both a formative study on Mechanical Turk to assess and tune our ranking function, and a summative study in which 8 experienced visualization developers implement animations in D3 that we then compare to Gemini's suggestions. We find that most designs (9/11) are exactly replicable in Gemini, with many (8/11) achievable via edits to suggestions, and that Gemini suggestions avoid multiple participant errors."
A Flexible Multi-Volume Shader Framework for Arbitrarily Intersecting Multi-Resolution Datasets,2007,Vis,30.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a powerful framework for 3D-texture-based rendering of multiple arbitrarily intersecting volumetric datasets. Each volume is represented by a multi-resolution octree-based structure and we use out-of-core techniques to support extremely large volumes. Users define a set of convex polyhedral volume lenses, which may be associated with one or more volumetric datasets. The volumes or the lenses can be interactively moved around while the region inside each lens is rendered using interactively defined multi-volume shaders. Our rendering pipeline splits each lens into multiple convex regions such that each region is homogenous and contains a fixed number of volumes. Each such region is further split by the brick boundaries of the associated octree representations. The resulting puzzle of lens fragments is sorted in front-to-back or back-to-front order using a combination of a view-dependent octree traversal and a GPU-based depth peeling technique. Our current implementation uses slice-based volume rendering and allows interactive roaming through multiple intersecting multi-gigabyte volumes."
Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables,2021,Vis,29.0,['pipeline automation'],"Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets — the quintessential table tool — remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for <i>data workers</i> <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref61"">[61]</xref>, people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and “get their hands on” the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools."
Doccurate: A Curation-Based Approach for Clinical Text Visualization,2018,VAST,29.0,['pipeline automation'],"Before seeing a patient, physicians seek to obtain an overview of the patient's medical history. Text plays a major role in this activity since it represents the bulk of the clinical documentation, but reviewing it quickly becomes onerous when patient charts grow too large. Text visualization methods have been widely explored to manage this large scale through visual summaries that rely on information retrieval algorithms to structure text and make it amenable to visualization. However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the clinical notes. These drawbacks have limited the adoption of text visualization and other summarization technologies in clinical practice. In this work we present Doccurate, a novel system embodying a curation-based approach for the visualization of large clinical text datasets. Our approach offers automation auditing and customizability to physicians while also preserving and extensively linking to the original text. We discuss findings of a formal qualitative evaluation conducted with 6 domain experts, shedding light onto physicians' information needs, perceived strengths and limitations of automated tools, and the importance of customization while balancing efficiency. We also present use case scenarios to showcase Doccurate's envisioned usage in practice."
Towards Utilizing GPUs in Information Visualization: A Model and Implementation of Image-Space Operations,2009,InfoVis,29.0,['pipeline automation'],"Modern programmable GPUs represent a vast potential in terms of performance and visual flexibility for information visualization research, but surprisingly few applications even begin to utilize this potential. In this paper, we conjecture that this may be due to the mismatch between the high-level abstract data types commonly visualized in our field, and the low-level floating-point model supported by current GPU shader languages. To help remedy this situation, we present a refinement of the traditional information visualization pipeline that is amenable to implementation using GPU shaders. The refinement consists of a final image-space step in the pipeline where the multivariate data of the visualization is sampled in the resolution of the current view. To concretize the theoretical aspects of this work, we also present a visual programming environment for constructing visualization shaders using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Finally, we give some examples of the use of shaders for well-known visualization techniques."
Concurrent Visualization in a Production Supercomputing Environment,2006,Vis,29.0,['pipeline automation'],"We describe a concurrent visualization pipeline designed for operation in a production supercomputing environment. The facility was initially developed on the NASA Ames ""Columbia"" supercomputer for a massively parallel forecast model (GEOS4). During the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, GEOS4 was run 4 times a day under tight time constraints so that its output could be included in an ensemble prediction that was made available to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center. Given this time-critical context, we designed a configurable concurrent pipeline to visualize multiple global fields without significantly affecting the runtime model performance or reliability. We use MPEG compression of the accruing images to facilitate live low-bandwidth distribution of multiple visualization streams to remote sites. We also describe the use of our concurrent visualization framework with a global ocean circulation model, which provides a 864-fold increase in the temporal resolution of practically achievable animations. In both the atmospheric and oceanic circulation models, the application scientists gained new insights into their model dynamics, due to the high temporal resolution animations attainable"
Collaborative visualization,1997,Vis,28.0,['pipeline automation'],"Current visualization systems are designed around a single user model, making it awkward for large research teams to collectively analyse large data sets. The paper shows how the popular data flow approach to visualization can be extended to allow multiple users to collaborate-each running their own visualization pipeline but with the opportunity to connect in data generated by a colleague, Thus collaborative visualizations are 'programmed' in exactly the same 'plug-and-play' style as is now customary for single-user mode. The paper describes a system architecture that can act as a basis for the collaborative extension of any data flow visualization system, and the ideas are demonstrated through a particular implementation in terms of IRIS Explorer."
VizCommender: Computing Text-Based Similarity in Visualization Repositories for Content-Based Recommendations,2020,VAST,28.0,['recommendation'],"Cloud-based visualization services have made visual analytics accessible to a much wider audience than ever before. Systems such as Tableau have started to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information. Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from these visualization specifications and how various natural language processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as one way to measure relevance. We report on a crowd-sourced user study to determine if our similarity measure mimics human judgement. Finally, we choose latent Dirichl et al.ocation (LDA) as a specific model and instantiate it in a proof-of-concept recommender tool to demonstrate the basic function of our similarity measure."
Globe Browsing: Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Planetary Surface Visualization,2017,SciVis,28.0,['pipeline automation'],"Results of planetary mapping are often shared openly for use in scientific research and mission planning. In its raw format, however, the data is not accessible to non-experts due to the difficulty in grasping the context and the intricate acquisition process. We present work on tailoring and integration of multiple data processing and visualization methods to interactively contextualize geospatial surface data of celestial bodies for use in science communication. As our approach handles dynamic data sources, streamed from online repositories, we are significantly shortening the time between discovery and dissemination of data and results. We describe the image acquisition pipeline, the pre-processing steps to derive a 2.5D terrain, and a chunked level-of-detail, out-of-core rendering approach to enable interactive exploration of global maps and high-resolution digital terrain models. The results are demonstrated for three different celestial bodies. The first case addresses high-resolution map data on the surface of Mars. A second case is showing dynamic processes, such as concurrent weather conditions on Earth that require temporal datasets. As a final example we use data from the New Horizons spacecraft which acquired images during a single flyby of Pluto. We visualize the acquisition process as well as the resulting surface data. Our work has been implemented in the OpenSpace software [8], which enables interactive presentations in a range of environments such as immersive dome theaters, interactive touch tables, and virtual reality headsets."
Image-based transfer function design for data exploration in volume visualization,1998,Vis,27.0,['pipeline automation'],"Transfer function design is an integrated component in volume visualization and data exploration. The common trial-and-error approach for transfer function searching is a very difficult and time consuming process. A goal oriented and parameterized transfer function model is therefore crucial in guiding the transfer function searching process for better and more meaningful visualization results. The paper presents an image based transfer function model that integrates 3D image processing tools into the volume visualization pipeline to facilitate the search for an image based transfer function in volume data visualization and exploration. The model defines a transfer function as a sequence of 3D image processing procedures, and allows the users to adjust a set of qualitative and descriptive parameters to achieve their subjective visualization goals. 3D image enhancement and boundary detection tools, and their integration methods with volume visualization algorithms are described. The application of this approach for 3D microscopy data exploration and analysis is also discussed."
MetroSets: Visualizing Sets as Metro Maps,2020,InfoVis,27.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose MetroSets, a new, flexible online tool for visualizing set systems using the metro map metaphor. We model a given set system as a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,\ \mathcal{S})$, consisting of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $\mathcal{S}$, which contains subsets of $V$ called hyperedges. Our system then computes a metro map representation of $\mathcal{H}$, where each hyperedge $E$ in $\mathcal{S}$ corresponds to a metro line and each vertex corresponds to a metro station. Vertices that appear in two or more hyperedges are drawn as interchanges in the metro map, connecting the different sets. MetroSets is based on a modular 4-step pipeline which constructs and optimizes a path-based hypergraph support, which is then drawn and schematized using metro map layout algorithms. We propose and implement multiple algorithms for each step of the MetroSet pipeline and provide a functional prototype with easy-to-use preset configurations. Furthermore, using several real-world datasets, we perform an extensive quantitative evaluation of the impact of different pipeline stages on desirable properties of the generated maps, such as octolinearity, monotonicity, and edge uniformity."
High-Quality Ultra-Compact Grid Layout of Grouped Networks,2015,InfoVis,27.0,['pipeline automation'],"Prior research into network layout has focused on fast heuristic techniques for layout of large networks, or complex multi-stage pipelines for higher quality layout of small graphs. Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks."
PromptMagician: Interactive Prompt Engineering for Text-to-Image Creation,2023,Vis,26.0,['recommendation'],"Generative text-to-image models have gained great popularity among the public for their powerful capability to generate high-quality images based on natural language prompts. However, developing effective prompts for desired images can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. This research proposes PromptMagician, a visual analysis system that helps users explore the image results and refine the input prompts. The backbone of our system is a prompt recommendation model that takes user prompts as input, retrieves similar prompt-image pairs from DiffusionDB, and identifies special (important and relevant) prompt keywords. To facilitate interactive prompt refinement, PromptMagician introduces a multi-level visualization for the cross-modal embedding of the retrieved images and recommended keywords, and supports users in specifying multiple criteria for personalized exploration. Two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system, suggesting it facilitates prompt engineering and improves the creativity support of the generative text-to-image model."
Towards Natural Language-Based Visualization Authoring,2022,Vis,26.0,['pipeline automation'],"A key challenge to visualization authoring is the process of getting familiar with the complex user interfaces of authoring tools. Natural Language Interface (NLI) presents promising benefits due to its learnability and usability. However, supporting NLIs for authoring tools requires expertise in natural language processing, while existing NLIs are mostly designed for visual analytic workflow. In this paper, we propose an authoring-oriented NLI pipeline by introducing a structured representation of users' visualization editing intents, called editing actions, based on a formative study and an extensive survey on visualization construction tools. The editing actions are executable, and thus decouple natural language interpretation and visualization applications as an intermediate layer. We implement a deep learning-based NL interpreter to translate NL utterances into editing actions. The interpreter is reusable and extensible across authoring tools. The authoring tools only need to map the editing actions into tool-specific operations. To illustrate the usages of the NL interpreter, we implement an Excel chart editor and a proof-of-concept authoring tool, VisTalk. We conduct a user study with VisTalk to understand the usage patterns of NL-based authoring systems. Finally, we discuss observations on how users author charts with natural language, as well as implications for future research."
Mixed-initiative visual analytics using task-driven recommendations,2015,VAST,25.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Visual data analysis is composed of a collection of cognitive actions and tasks to decompose, internalize, and recombine data to produce knowledge and insight. Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace. This paper provides an illustrative use case, a technical description of ADE, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach."
An Evaluation-Focused Framework for Visualization Recommendation Algorithms,2021,Vis,25.0,['recommendation'],"Although we have seen a proliferation of algorithms for recommending visualizations, these algorithms are rarely compared with one another, making it difficult to ascertain which algorithm is best for a given visual analysis scenario. Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an <i>evaluation</i> perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios."
Transformation of an Uncertain Video Search Pipeline to a Sketch-Based Visual Analytics Loop,2013,VAST,25.0,['pipeline automation'],"Traditional sketch-based image or video search systems rely on machine learning concepts as their core technology. However, in many applications, machine learning alone is impractical since videos may not be semantically annotated sufficiently, there may be a lack of suitable training data, and the search requirements of the user may frequently change for different tasks. In this work, we develop a visual analytics systems that overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional approach. We make use of a sketch-based interface to enable users to specify search requirement in a flexible manner without depending on semantic annotation. We employ active machine learning to train different analytical models for different types of search requirements. We use visualization to facilitate knowledge discovery at the different stages of visual analytics. This includes visualizing the parameter space of the trained model, visualizing the search space to support interactive browsing, visualizing candidature search results to support rapid interaction for active learning while minimizing watching videos, and visualizing aggregated information of the search results. We demonstrate the system for searching spatiotemporal attributes from sports video to identify key instances of the team and player performance."
A Generic and Scalable Pipeline for GPU Tetrahedral Grid Rendering,2006,Vis,25.0,['pipeline automation'],"Recent advances in algorithms and graphics hardware have opened the possibility to render tetrahedral grids at interactive rates on commodity PCs. This paper extends on this work in that it presents a direct volume rendering method for such grids which supports both current and upcoming graphics hardware architectures, large and deformable grids, as well as different rendering options. At the core of our method is the idea to perform the sampling of tetrahedral elements along the view rays entirely in local barycentric coordinates. Then, sampling requires minimum GPU memory and texture access operations, and it maps efficiently onto a feed-forward pipeline of multiple stages performing computation and geometry construction. We propose to spawn rendered elements from one single vertex. This makes the method amenable to upcoming Direct3D 10 graphics hardware which allows to create geometry on the GPU. By only modifying the algorithm slightly it can be used to render per-pixel iso-surfaces and to perform tetrahedral cell projection. As our method neither requires any pre-processing nor an intermediate grid representation it can efficiently deal with dynamic and large 3D meshes"
Hybrid segmentation and exploration of the human lungs,2003,Vis,24.0,['pipeline automation'],"Segmentation of the tracheo-bronchial tree of the lungs is notoriously difficult. This is due to the fact that the small size of some of the anatomical structures is subject to partial volume effects. Furthermore, the limited intensity contrast between the participating materials (air, blood, and tissue) increases the segmentation of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which is based on a pipeline of three segmentation stages to extract the lower airways down to the seventh generation of the bronchi. User interaction is limited to the specification of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea at the upper end of the lower airways. Similarly, the complementary vascular tree of the lungs can be segmented. Furthermore, we modified our virtual endoscopy system to visualize the vascular and airway system of the lungs along with other features, such as lung tumors."
Collaborative Visual Analytics: Inferring from the Spatial Organization and Collaborative Use of Information,2006,VAST,24.0,['agents'],"We introduce a visual analytics environment for the support of remote-collaborative sense-making activities. Team members use their individual graphical interfaces to collect, organize and comprehend task-relevant information relative to their areas of expertise. A system of computational agents infers possible relationships among information items through the analysis of the spatial and temporal organization and collaborative use of information. The computational agents support the exchange of information among team members to converge their individual contributions. Our system allows users to navigate vast amounts of shared information effectively and remotely dispersed team members to work independently without diverting from common objectives as well as to minimize the necessary amount of verbal communication"
Towards Visual Explainable Active Learning for Zero-Shot Classification,2021,Vis,24.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Zero-shot classification is a promising paradigm to solve an applicable problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification."
Visualization of Temporal Similarity in field Data,2012,SciVis,24.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper presents a visualization approach for detecting and exploring similarity in the temporal variation of field data. We provide an interactive technique for extracting correlations from similarity matrices which capture temporal similarity of univariate functions. We make use of the concept to extract periodic and quasiperiodic behavior at single (spatial) points as well as similarity between different locations within a field and also between different data sets. The obtained correlations are utilized for visual exploration of both temporal and spatial relationships in terms of temporal similarity. Our entire pipeline offers visual interaction and inspection, allowing for the flexibility that in particular time-dependent data analysis techniques require. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our approach by applying our implementation to data from both simulation and measurement."
Pen-and-ink rendering in volume visualisation,2000,Vis,23.0,['pipeline automation'],"Concerns the development of non-photorealistic rendering techniques for volume visualisation. In particular, we present two pen-and-ink rendering methods, a 3D method based on non-photorealistic solid textures, and a 2/sup +/D method that involves two rendering phases in the object space and the image space respectively. As both techniques utilize volume- and image-based data representations, they can be built upon a traditional volume rendering pipeline, and can be integrated with the photorealistic methods available in such a pipeline. We demonstrate that such an integration facilitates an effective mechanism for enhancing visualisation and its interpretation."
Visual Verification of Space Weather Ensemble Simulations,2015,SciVis,23.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a system to analyze and contextualize simulations of coronal mass ejections. As current simulation techniques require manual input, uncertainty is introduced into the simulation pipeline leading to inaccurate predictions that can be mitigated through ensemble simulations. We provide the space weather analyst with a multi-view system providing visualizations to: 1. compare ensemble members against ground truth measurements, 2. inspect time-dependent information derived from optical flow analysis of satellite images, and 3. combine satellite images with a volumetric rendering of the simulations. This three-tier workflow provides experts with tools to discover correlations between errors in predictions and simulation parameters, thus increasing knowledge about the evolution and propagation of coronal mass ejections that pose a danger to Earth and interplanetary travel."
Projection-Based Metal-Artifact Reduction for Industrial 3D X-ray Computed Tomography,2011,Vis,22.0,['pipeline automation'],"Multi-material components, which contain metal parts surrounded by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization."
A multi-threaded streaming pipeline architecture for large structured data sets,1999,Vis,21.0,['pipeline automation'],"Computer simulation and digital measuring systems are now generating data of unprecedented size. The size of data is becoming so large that conventional visualization tools are incapable of processing it, which is in turn is impacting the effectiveness of computational tools. In this paper we describe an object-oriented architecture that addresses this problem by automatically breaking data into pieces, and then processes the data piece-by-piece within a pipeline of filters. The piece size is user specified and can be controlled to eliminate the need for swapping (i.e., relying on virtual memory). In addition, because piece size can be controlled, any size problem can be run on any size computer, at the expense of extra computational time. Furthermore pieces are automatically broken into sub-pieces and each piece assigned to a different thread for parallel processing. This paper includes numerical performance studies and references to the source code which is freely available on the Web."
COVID-view: Diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest CT,2021,Vis,21.0,['pipeline automation'],"Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present <i>COVID-view</i>, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. <i>COVID-view</i> incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using <i>COVID-view</i> and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated <i>COVID-view</i> through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases."
THALIS: Human-Machine Analysis of Longitudinal Symptoms in Cancer Therapy,2021,Vis,21.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research."
An Efficient Direct Volume Rendering Approach for Dichromats,2011,Vis,21.0,['pipeline automation'],"Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects a high percentage of the population worldwide. When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time."
Time Dependent Processing in a Parallel Pipeline Architecture,2007,Vis,21.0,['pipeline automation'],"Pipeline architectures provide a versatile and efficient mechanism for constructing visualizations, and they have been implemented in numerous libraries and applications over the past two decades. In addition to allowing developers and users to freely combine algorithms, visualization pipelines have proven to work well when streaming data and scale well on parallel distributed- memory computers. However, current pipeline visualization frameworks have a critical flaw: they are unable to manage time varying data. As data flows through the pipeline, each algorithm has access to only a single snapshot in time of the data. This prevents the implementation of algorithms that do any temporal processing such as particle tracing; plotting over time; or interpolation, fitting, or smoothing of time series data. As data acquisition technology improves, as simulation time-integration techniques become more complex, and as simulations save less frequently and regularly, the ability to analyze the time-behavior of data becomes more important. This paper describes a modification to the traditional pipeline architecture that allows it to accommodate temporal algorithms. Furthermore, the architecture allows temporal algorithms to be used in conjunction with algorithms expecting a single time snapshot, thus simplifying software design and allowing adoption into existing pipeline frameworks. Our architecture also continues to work well in parallel distributed-memory environments. We demonstrate our architecture by modifying the popular VTK framework and exposing the functionality to the ParaView application. We use this framework to apply time-dependent algorithms on large data with a parallel cluster computer and thereby exercise a functionality that previously did not exist."
Query-driven visualization of large data sets,2005,Vis,20.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a practical and general-purpose approach to large and complex visual data analysis where visualization processing, rendering and subsequent human interpretation is constrained to the subset of data deemed interesting by the user. In many scientific data analysis applications, ""interesting"" data can be defined by compound Boolean range queries of the form (temperature&gt;1000) AND (70&lt;pressure&lt;90). As data sizes grow larger, a central challenge is to answer such queries as efficiently as possible. Prior work in the visualization community has focused on answering range queries for scalar fields within the context of accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. In contrast, our work describes an approach that leverages state-of-the-art indexing technology from the scientific data management community called ""bitmap indexing"". Our implementation, which we call ""DEX"" (short for dextrous data explorer), uses bitmap indexing to efficiently answer multivariate, multidimensional data queries to provide input to a visualization pipeline. We present an analysis overview and benchmark results that show bitmap indexing offers significant storage and performance improvements when compared to previous approaches for accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. More importantly, since bitmap indexing supports complex multidimensional, multivariate range queries, it is more generally applicable to scientific data visualization and analysis problems. In addition to benchmark performance and analysis, we apply DEX to a typical scientific visualization problem encountered in combustion simulation data analysis."
Connecting the dots in visual analysis,2009,VAST,20.0,['recommendation'],"During visual analysis, users must often connect insights discovered at various points of time. This process is often called ldquoconnecting the dots.rdquo When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this recommendation feature in HARVEST, a Web based visual analytic system. We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through a case study and discuss the implications of our approach."
Visual Interaction with Deep Learning Models through Collaborative Semantic Inference,2019,VAST,20.0,['pipeline automation'],"Automation of tasks can have critical consequences when humans lose agency over decision processes. Deep learning models are particularly susceptible since current black-box approaches lack explainable reasoning. We argue that both the visual interface and model structure of deep learning systems need to take into account interaction design. We propose a framework of collaborative semantic inference (CSI) for the co-design of interactions and models to enable visual collaboration between humans and algorithms. The approach exposes the intermediate reasoning process of models which allows semantic interactions with the visual metaphors of a problem, which means that a user can both understand and control parts of the model reasoning process. We demonstrate the feasibility of CSI with a co-designed case study of a document summarization system."
Visual Compression of Workflow Visualizations with Automated Detection of Macro Motifs,2013,InfoVis,20.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper is concerned with the creation of 'macros' in workflow visualization as a support tool to increase the efficiency of data curation tasks. We propose computation of candidate macros based on their usage in large collections of workflows in data repositories. We describe an efficient algorithm for extracting macro motifs from workflow graphs. We discovered that the state transition information, used to identify macro candidates, characterizes the structural pattern of the macro and can be harnessed as part of the visual design of the corresponding macro glyph. This facilitates partial automation and consistency in glyph design applicable to a large set of macro glyphs. We tested this approach against a repository of biological data holding some 9,670 workflows and found that the algorithmically generated candidate macros are in keeping with domain expert expectations."
Verifiable Visualization for Isosurface Extraction,2009,Vis,20.0,['pipeline automation'],"Visual representations of isosurfaces are ubiquitous in the scientific and engineering literature. In this paper, we present techniques to assess the behavior of isosurface extraction codes. Where applicable, these techniques allow us to distinguish whether anomalies in isosurface features can be attributed to the underlying physical process or to artifacts from the extraction process. Such scientific scrutiny is at the heart of verifiable visualization - subjecting visualization algorithms to the same verification process that is used in other components of the scientific pipeline. More concretely, we derive formulas for the expected order of accuracy (or convergence rate) of several isosurface features, and compare them to experimentally observed results in the selected codes. This technique is practical: in two cases, it exposed actual problems in implementations. We provide the reader with the range of responses they can expect to encounter with isosurface techniques, both under ldquonormal operating conditionsrdquo and also under adverse conditions. Armed with this information - the results of the verification process - practitioners can judiciously select the isosurface extraction technique appropriate for their problem of interest, and have confidence in its behavior."
GL4D: A GPU-based Architecture for Interactive 4D Visualization,2009,Vis,20.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper describes GL4D, an interactive system for visualizing 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds embedded in four Euclidean dimensions and illuminated by 4D light sources. It is a tetrahedron-based rendering pipeline that projects geometry into volume images, an exact parallel to the conventional triangle-based rendering pipeline for 3D graphics. Novel features include GPU-based algorithms for real-time 4D occlusion handling and transparency compositing; we thus enable a previously impossible level of quality and interactivity for exploring lit 4D objects. The 4D tetrahedrons are stored in GPU memory as vertex buffer objects, and the vertex shader is used to perform per-vertex 4D modelview transformations and 4D-to-3D projection. The geometry shader extension is utilized to slice the projected tetrahedrons and rasterize the slices into individual 2D layers of voxel fragments. Finally, the fragment shader performs per-voxel operations such as lighting and alpha blending with previously computed layers. We account for 4D voxel occlusion along the 4D-to-3D projection ray by supporting a multi-pass back-to-front fragment composition along the projection ray; to accomplish this, we exploit a new adaptation of the dual depth peeling technique to produce correct volume image data and to simultaneously render the resulting volume data using 3D transfer functions into the final 2D image. Previous CPU implementations of the rendering of 4D-embedded 3-manifolds could not perform either the 4D depth-buffered projection or manipulation of the volume-rendered image in real-time; in particular, the dual depth peeling algorithm is a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 4D depth-buffering problem. GL4D is implemented as an integrated OpenGL-style API library, so that the underlying shader operations are as transparent as possible to the user."
Visual Arrangements of Bar Charts Influence Comparisons in Viewer Takeaways,2021,Vis,19.0,['recommendation'],"Well-designed data visualizations can lead to more powerful and intuitive processing by a viewer. To help a viewer intuitively compare values to quickly generate key takeaways, visualization designers can manipulate how data values are arranged in a chart to afford particular comparisons. Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings. These results provide concrete guidelines for how both human designers and automatic chart recommendation systems can make visualizations that help viewers extract the “right” takeaway."
Semantic Concept Spaces: Guided Topic Model Refinement using Word-Embedding Projections,2019,VAST,18.0,['mixed-initiative'],"We present a framework that allows users to incorporate the semantics of their domain knowledge for topic model refinement while remaining model-agnostic. Our approach enables users to (1) understand the semantic space of the model, (2) identify regions of potential conflicts and problems, and (3) readjust the semantic relation of concepts based on their understanding, directly influencing the topic modeling. These tasks are supported by an interactive visual analytics workspace that uses word-embedding projections to define concept regions which can then be refined. The user-refined concepts are independent of a particular document collection and can be transferred to related corpora. All user interactions within the concept space directly affect the semantic relations of the underlying vector space model, which, in turn, change the topic modeling. In addition to direct manipulation, our system guides the users' decision-making process through recommended interactions that point out potential improvements. This targeted refinement aims at minimizing the feedback required for an efficient human-in-the-loop process. We confirm the improvements achieved through our approach in two user studies that show topic model quality improvements through our visual knowledge externalization and learning process."
iView: A Feature Clustering Framework for Suggesting Informative Views in Volume Visualization,2011,Vis,18.0,['pipeline automation'],"The unguided visual exploration of volumetric data can be both a challenging and a time-consuming undertaking. Identifying a set of favorable vantage points at which to start exploratory expeditions can greatly reduce this effort and can also ensure that no important structures are being missed. Recent research efforts have focused on entropy-based viewpoint selection criteria that depend on scalar values describing the structures of interest. In contrast, we propose a viewpoint suggestion pipeline that is based on feature-clustering in high-dimensional space. We use gradient/normal variation as a metric to identify interesting local events and then cluster these via k-means to detect important salient composite features. Next, we compute the maximum possible exposure of these composite feature for different viewpoints and calculate a 2D entropy map parameterized in longitude and latitude to point out promising view orientations. Superimposed onto an interactive track-ball interface, users can then directly use this entropy map to quickly navigate to potentially interesting viewpoints where visibility-based transfer functions can be employed to generate volume renderings that minimize occlusions. To give full exploration freedom to the user, the entropy map is updated on the fly whenever a view has been selected, pointing to new and promising but so far unseen view directions. Alternatively, our system can also use a set-cover optimization algorithm to provide a minimal set of views needed to observe all features. The views so generated could then be saved into a list for further inspection or into a gallery for a summary presentation."
Extraction of topologically simple isosurfaces from volume datasets,2003,Vis,17.0,['pipeline automation'],"There are numerous algorithms in graphics and visualization whose performance is known to decay as the topological complexity of the input increases. On the other hand, the standard pipeline for 3D geometry acquisition often produces 3D models that are topologically more complex than their real forms. We present a simple and efficient algorithm that allows us to simplify the topology of an isosurface by alternating the values of some number of voxels. Its utility and performance are demonstrated on several examples, including signed distance functions from polygonal models and CT scans."
Integrating Prior Knowledge in Mixed-Initiative Social Network Clustering,2020,VAST,17.0,['mixed-initiative'],"We propose a new approach-called PK-clustering-to help social scientists create meaningful clusters in social networks. Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our approach using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists. We believe our clustering approach offers a novel constructive method to iteratively build knowledge while avoiding being overly influenced by the results of often randomly selected black-box clustering algorithms."
Enabling Classification and Shading for 3D Texture Mapping based Volume Rendering using OpenGL and Extensions,1999,Vis,16.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a new technique which enables direct volume rendering based on 3D texture mapping hardware, enabling shading as well as classification of the interpolated data. Our technique supports accurate lighting for a one directional light source, semi-transparent classification, and correct blending. To circumvent the limitations of one general classification, we introduce multiple classification spaces which are very valuable to understand the visualized data, and even mandatory to comprehensively grasp the 3D relationship of different materials present in the volumetric data. Furthermore, we illustrate how multiple classification spaces can be realized using existing graphics hardware. In contrast to previously reported algorithms, our technique is capable of performing all the above mentioned tasks within the graphics pipeline. Therefore, it is very efficient: The three dimensional texture needs to be stored only once and no load is put onto the CPU. Besides using standard OpenGL functionality, we exploit advanced per pixel operations and make use of available OpenGL extensions."
CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs,2020,VAST,16.0,['pipeline automation'],"Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline."
Visualization Multi-Pipeline for Communicating Biology,2017,SciVis,16.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a system to facilitate biology communication by developing a pipeline to support the instructional visualization of heterogeneous biological data on heterogeneous user-devices. Discoveries and concepts in biology are typically summarized with illustrations assembled manually from the interpretation and application of heterogenous data. The creation of such illustrations is time consuming, which makes it incompatible with frequent updates to the measured data as new discoveries are made. Illustrations are typically non-interactive, and when an illustration is updated, it still has to reach the user. Our system is designed to overcome these three obstacles. It supports the integration of heterogeneous datasets, reflecting the knowledge that is gained from different data sources in biology. After pre-processing the datasets, the system transforms them into visual representations as inspired by scientific illustrations. As opposed to traditional scientific illustration these representations are generated in real-time - they are interactive. The code generating the visualizations can be embedded in various software environments. To demonstrate this, we implemented both a desktop application and a remote-rendering server in which the pipeline is embedded. The remote-rendering server supports multi-threaded rendering and it is able to handle multiple users simultaneously. This scalability to different hardware environments, including multi-GPU setups, makes our system useful for efficient public dissemination of biological discoveries."
Toward Theoretical Techniques for Measuring the Use of Human Effort in Visual Analytic Systems,2016,VAST,16.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Visual analytic systems have long relied on user studies and standard datasets to demonstrate advances to the state of the art, as well as to illustrate the efficiency of solutions to domain-specific challenges. This approach has enabled some important comparisons between systems, but unfortunately the narrow scope required to facilitate these comparisons has prevented many of these lessons from being generalized to new areas. At the same time, advanced visual analytic systems have made increasing use of human-machine collaboration to solve problems not tractable by machine computation alone. To continue to make progress in modeling user tasks in these hybrid visual analytic systems, we must strive to gain insight into what makes certain tasks more complex than others. This will require the development of mechanisms for describing the balance to be struck between machine and human strengths with respect to analytical tasks and workload. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of theoretical tools for reasoning about such balance in visual analytic systems and demonstrate the utility of the Human Oracle Model for this purpose in the context of sensemaking in visual analytics. Additionally, we make use of the Human Oracle Model to guide the development of a new system through a case study in the domain of cybersecurity."
Colon Flattening Using Heat Diffusion Riemannian Metric,2013,SciVis,16.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a new colon flattening algorithm that is efficient, shape-preserving, and robust to topological noise. Unlike previous approaches, which require a mandatory topological denoising to remove fake handles, our algorithm directly flattens the colon surface without any denoising. In our method, we replace the original Euclidean metric of the colon surface with a heat diffusion metric that is insensitive to topological noise. Using this heat diffusion metric, we then solve a Laplacian equation followed by an integration step to compute the final flattening. We demonstrate that our method is shape-preserving and the shape of the polyps are well preserved. The flattened colon also provides an efficient way to enhance the navigation and inspection in virtual colonoscopy. We further show how the existing colon registration pipeline is made more robust by using our colon flattening. We have tested our method on several colon wall surfaces and the experimental results demonstrate the robustness and the efficiency of our method."
Origraph: Interactive Network Wrangling,2019,VAST,15.0,['pipeline automation'],"Networks are a natural way of thinking about many datasets. The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen."
VITALITY: Promoting Serendipitous Discovery of Academic Literature with Transformers &amp; Visual Analytics,2021,Vis,15.0,['mixed-initiative'],"There are a few prominent practices for conducting reviews of academic literature, including searching for specific keywords on Google Scholar or checking citations from some initial seed paper(s). These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues."
Exploring Time-Varying Multivariate Volume Data Using Matrix of Isosurface Similarity Maps,2018,SciVis,15.0,['recommendation'],"We present a novel visual representation and interface named the matrix of isosurface similarity maps (MISM) for effective exploration of large time-varying multivariate volumetric data sets. MISM synthesizes three types of similarity maps (i.e., self, temporal, and variable similarity maps) to capture the essential relationships among isosurfaces of different variables and time steps. Additionally, it serves as the main visual mapping and navigation tool for examining the vast number of isosurfaces and exploring the underlying time-varying multivariate data set. We present temporal clustering, variable grouping, and interactive filtering to reduce the huge exploration space of MISM. In conjunction with the isovalue and isosurface views, MISM allows users to identify important isosurfaces or isosurface pairs and compare them over space, time, and value range. More importantly, we introduce path recommendation that suggests, animates, and compares traversal paths for effectively exploring MISM under varied criteria and at different levels-of-detail. A silhouette-based method is applied to render multiple surfaces of interest in a visually succinct manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with case studies of several time-varying multivariate data sets and an ensemble data set, and evaluate our work with two domain experts."
"High-Quality, Semi-Analytical Volume Rendering for AMR Data",2009,Vis,15.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper presents a pipeline for high quality volume rendering of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) datasets. We introduce a new method allowing high quality visualization of hexahedral cells in this context; this method avoids artifacts like discontinuities in the isosurfaces. To achieve this, we choose the number and placement of sampling points over the cast rays according to the analytical properties of the reconstructed signal inside each cell. We extend our method to handle volume shading of such cells. We propose an interpolation scheme that guarantees continuity between adjacent cells of different AMR levels. We introduce an efficient hybrid CPU-GPU mesh traversal technique. We present an implementation of our AMR visualization method on current graphics hardware, and show results demonstrating both the quality and performance of our method."
Interactive exploration of large remote micro-CT scans,2004,Vis,14.0,['pipeline automation'],"Datasets of tens of gigabytes are becoming common in computational and experimental science. This development is driven by advances in imaging technology, producing detectors with growing resolutions, as well as availability of cheap processing power and memory capacity in commodity-based computing clusters. We describe the design of a visualization system that allows scientists to interactively explore large remote data sets in an efficient and flexible way. The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering. Interactive visualization is accomplished using a background thread to access the datasets stored in a multiresolution format. A hierarchical volume tenderer provides seamless integration of high resolution details with low resolution overviews."
DashBot: Insight-Driven Dashboard Generation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,Vis,14.0,"['recommendation', 'agents']","Analytical dashboards are popular in business intelligence to facilitate insight discovery with multiple charts. However, creating an effective dashboard is highly demanding, which requires users to have adequate data analysis background and be familiar with professional tools, such as Power BI. To create a dashboard, users have to configure charts by selecting data columns and exploring different chart combinations to optimize the communication of insights, which is trial-and-error. Recent research has started to use deep learning methods for dashboard generation to lower the burden of visualization creation. However, such efforts are greatly hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets of dashboards. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use well-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we use visualization knowledge to construct a training environment and rewards for agents to explore and imitate human exploration behavior with a well-designed agent network. The usefulness of the deep reinforcement learning model is demonstrated through ablation studies and user studies. In conclusion, our work opens up new opportunities to develop effective ML-based visualization recommenders without beforehand training datasets."
A Visualization Approach for Monitoring Order Processing in E-Commerce Warehouse,2021,Vis,14.0,['pipeline automation'],"The efficiency of warehouses is vital to e-commerce. Fast order processing at the warehouses ensures timely deliveries and improves customer satisfaction. However, monitoring, analyzing, and manipulating order processing in the warehouses in real time are challenging for traditional methods due to the sheer volume of incoming orders, the fuzzy definition of delayed order patterns, and the complex decision-making of order handling priorities. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance. The effectiveness of OrderMonitor is evaluated with two case studies on a real-world warehouse dataset."
Mining Graphs for Understanding Time-Varying Volumetric Data,2015,SciVis,14.0,['recommendation'],"A notable recent trend in time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization is to extract data relationships and represent them in a low-dimensional abstract graph view for visual understanding and making connections to the underlying data. Nevertheless, the ever-growing size and complexity of data demands novel techniques that go beyond standard brushing and linking to allow significant reduction of cognition overhead and interaction cost. In this paper, we present a mining approach that automatically extracts meaningful features from a graph-based representation for exploring time-varying volumetric data. This is achieved through the utilization of a series of graph analysis techniques including graph simplification, community detection, and visual recommendation. We investigate the most important transition relationships for time-varying data and evaluate our solution with several time-varying data sets of different sizes and characteristics. For gaining insights from the data, we show that our solution is more efficient and effective than simply asking users to extract relationships via standard interaction techniques, especially when the data set is large and the relationships are complex. We also collect expert feedback to confirm the usefulness of our approach."
Automatic Tuning of Spatially Varying Transfer Functions for Blood Vessel Visualization,2012,SciVis,14.0,['agents'],"Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is commonly used in clinical routine for diagnosing vascular diseases. The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimization-based method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration."
Texture-based visualization of uncertainty in flow fields,2005,Vis,13.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this paper, we present two novel texture-based techniques to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection perpendicular to the flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the density of flow representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multi-frequency noise approach."
Hardware-based nonlinear filtering and segmentation using high-level shading languages,2003,Vis,13.0,['pipeline automation'],"Non-linear filtering is an important task for volume analysis. This paper presents hardware-based implementations of various non-linear filters for volume smoothing with edge preservation. The Cg high-level shading language is used in combination with latest PC consumer graphics hardware. Filtering is divided into pervertex and per-fragment stages. In both stages we propose techniques to increase the filtering performance. The vertex program pre-computes texture coordinates in order to address all contributing input samples of the operator mask. Thus additional computations are avoided in the fragment program. The presented fragment programs preserve cache coherence, exploit 4D vector arithmetic, and internal fixed point arithmetic to increase performance. We show the applicability of non-linear filters as part of a GPU-based segmentation pipeline. The resulting binary mask is compressed and decompressed in the graphics memory on-the-fly."
A Mixed-Initiative Approach to Reusing Infographic Charts,2021,Vis,13.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Infographic bar charts have been widely adopted for communicating numerical information because of their attractiveness and memorability. However, these infographics are often created manually with general tools, such as PowerPoint and Adobe Illustrator, and merely composed of primitive visual elements, such as text blocks and shapes. With the absence of chart models, updating or reusing these infographics requires tedious and error-prone manual edits. In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative approach to mitigate this pain point. On one hand, machines are adopted to perform precise and trivial operations, such as mapping numerical values to shape attributes and aligning shapes. On the other hand, we rely on humans to perform subjective and creative tasks, such as changing embellishments or approving the edits made by machines. We encapsulate our technique in a PowerPoint add-in prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness by applying our technique on a diverse set of infographic bar chart examples."
"A voxel-based, forward projection algorithm for rendering surface and volumetric data",1992,Vis,11.0,['pipeline automation'],"A voxel-based, forward projection algorithm with a pipeline architecture for real-time applications is presented. The multisensor capabilities (electrooptical, or visual, and infrared) currently implemented in software have also been applied to non-real-time imaging applications on workstations and minicomputers. Most suited for terrain-based applications, the system features haze, imbedded targets, moving objects, smooth shading, and specular reflections.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;"
PorosityAnalyzer: Visual Analysis and Evaluation of Segmentation Pipelines to Determine the Porosity in Fiber-Reinforced Polymers,2016,VAST,11.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this paper we present PorosityAnalyzer, a novel tool for detailed evaluation and visual analysis of pore segmentation pipelines to determine the porosity in fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs). The presented tool consists of two modules: the computation module and the analysis module. The computation module enables a convenient setup and execution of distributed off-line-computations on industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography datasets. It allows the user to assemble individual segmentation pipelines in the form of single pipeline steps, and to specify the parameter ranges as well as the sampling of the parameter-space of each pipeline segment. The result of a single segmentation run consists of the input parameters, the calculated 3D binary-segmentation mask, the resulting porosity value, and other derived results (e.g., segmentation pipeline run-time). The analysis module presents the data at different levels of detail by drill-down filtering in order to determine accurate and robust segmentation pipelines. Overview visualizations allow to initially compare and evaluate the segmentation pipelines. With a scatter plot matrix (SPLOM), the segmentation pipelines are examined in more detail based on their input and output parameters. Individual segmentation-pipeline runs are selected in the SPLOM and visually examined and compared in 2D slice views and 3D renderings by using aggregated segmentation masks and statistical contour renderings. PorosityAnalyzer has been thoroughly evaluated with the help of twelve domain experts. Two case studies demonstrate the applicability of our proposed concepts and visualization techniques, and show that our tool helps domain experts to gain new insights and improve their workflow efficiency."
Data Player: Automatic Generation of Data Videos with Narration-Animation Interplay,2023,Vis,11.0,['recommendation'],"Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones."
A Simple Pipeline for Coherent Grid Maps,2020,InfoVis,11.0,['pipeline automation'],"Grid maps are spatial arrangements of simple tiles (often squares or hexagons), each of which represents a spatial element. They are an established, effective way to show complex data per spatial element, using visual encodings within each tile ranging from simple coloring to nested small-multiples visualizations. An effective grid map is coherent with the underlying geographic space: the tiles maintain the contiguity, neighborhoods and identifiability of the corresponding spatial elements, while the grid map as a whole maintains the global shape of the input. Of particular importance are salient local features of the global shape which need to be represented by tiles assigned to the appropriate spatial elements. State-of-the-art techniques can adequately deal only with simple cases, such as close-to-uniform spatial distributions or global shapes that have few characteristic features. We introduce a simple fully-automated 3-step pipeline for computing coherent grid maps. Each step is a well-studied problem: shape decomposition based on salient features, tile-based Mosaic Cartograms, and point-set matching. Our pipeline is a seamless composition of existing techniques for these problems and results in high-quality grid maps. We provide an implementation, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various complex datasets, and compare it to the state-of-the-art."
Relation-Aware Volume Exploration Pipeline,2008,Vis,11.0,['pipeline automation'],"Volume exploration is an important issue in scientific visualization. Research on volume exploration has been focused on revealing hidden structures in volumetric data. While the information of individual structures or features is useful in practice, spatial relations between structures are also important in many applications and can provide further insights into the data. In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement. We also introduce a quality assessment scheme which evaluates the perception of spatial relations in the rendered images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the practical use of our system in exploratory visualization."
Visualizing application behavior on superscalar processors,1999,InfoVis,11.0,['pipeline automation'],"The advent of superscalar processors with out-of-order execution makes it increasingly difficult to determine how well an application is utilizing the processor and how to adapt the application to improve its performance. We describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors. Our system provides an overview-plus-detail display of the application's execution. A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instuctions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application. This allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance. This visualization system can be easily configured to display a variety of processor models and configurations. We demonstrate it for both the MXS and MMIX processor models."
Production visualization for the ASCI One TeraFLOPS machine,1998,Vis,10.0,['pipeline automation'],"The delivery of the first one tera-operations/sec computer has significantly impacted production data visualization, affecting data transfer, post processing, and rendering. Terascale computing has motivated a need to consider the entire data visualization system; improving a single algorithm is not sufficient. This paper presents a systems approach to decrease by a factor of four the time required to prepare large data sets for visualization. For daily production use, all stages in the processing pipeline from physics simulation code to pixels on a screen, must be balanced to yield good overall performance. Performance of the initial visualization system is compared with recent improvements. ""Lessons learned"" from the coordinated deployment of improved algorithms also are discussed, including the need for 64 bit addressing and a fully parallel data visualization pipeline."
Interactive visualization of large scalar voxel fields,1992,Vis,10.0,['pipeline automation'],"A technique is given allowing interactive visualization of large, scalar, discrete volume fields as semitransparent clouds 'on the fly', i.e. without preprocessing. Interactivity is not restricted to geometric transformations, but includes all possible methods of processing the data. The system flexibly trades-off quality for performance at any desirable level. In particular, by using a scanline based method and a DDA-based traversing scheme instead of ray-tracing one achieves real-time processing during previewing. By means of the 'pyramidal volume' traversing technique, one achieves high-quality, constant-time filtering, independent of the data resolution. Several filters help to detect 'fuzzy', obscured hot spots, even within noisy data. The visualization pipeline allows the application of filters at four different stages, maximizing their flexibility. Four different illumination models have been implemented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;"
Polyphorm: Structural Analysis of Cosmological Datasets via Interactive Physarum Polycephalum Visualization,2020,SciVis,10.0,['agents'],"This paper introduces Polyphorm, an interactive visualization and model fitting tool that provides a novel approach for investigating cosmological datasets. Through a fast computational simulation method inspired by the behavior of Physarum polycephalum, an unicellular slime mold organism that efficiently forages for nutrients, astrophysicists are able to extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as galaxy maps archived in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these extrapolations to inform analyses of a wide range of other data, such as spectroscopic observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data. We describe details of Polyphorm's simulation model and its interaction and visualization modalities, and we evaluate Polyphorm through three scientific use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
fine-grained Visualization Pipelines and Lazy Functional Languages,2006,Vis,10.0,['pipeline automation'],"The pipeline model in visualization has evolved from a conceptual model of data processing into a widely used architecture for implementing visualization systems. In the process, a number of capabilities have been introduced, including streaming of data in chunks, distributed pipelines, and demand-driven processing. Visualization systems have invariably built on stateful programming technologies, and these capabilities have had to be implemented explicitly within the lower layers of a complex hierarchy of services. The good news for developers is that applications built on top of this hierarchy can access these capabilities without concern for how they are implemented. The bad news is that by freezing capabilities into low-level services expressive power and flexibility is lost. In this paper we express visualization systems in a programming language that more naturally supports this kind of processing model. Lazy functional languages support fine-grained demand-driven processing, a natural form of streaming, and pipeline-like function composition for assembling applications. The technology thus appears well suited to visualization applications. Using surface extraction algorithms as illustrative examples, and the lazy functional language Haskell, we argue the benefits of clear and concise expression combined with fine-grained, demand-driven computation. Just as visualization provides insight into data, functional abstraction provides new insight into visualization"
The automated multidimensional detective,1999,InfoVis,10.0,['pipeline automation'],"Automation has arrived to parallel coordinates. A geometrically motivated classifier is presented and applied, with both training and testing stages, to 3 real datasets. Our results compared to those from 33 other classifiers have the least error. The algorithm is based on parallel coordinates and has very low computational complexity in the number of variables and the size of the dataset-contrasted with the very high or unknown (often unstated) complexity of other classifiers, the low complexity enables the rule derivation to be done in near real-time hence making the classification adaptive to changing conditions, provides comprehensible and explicit rules-contrasted to neural networks which are ""black boxes"", does dimensionality selection-where the minimal set of original variables (not transformed new variables as in Principal Component Analysis) required to state the rule is found, orders these variables so as to optimize the clarity of separation between the designated set and its complement-this solves the pesky ""ordering problem"" in parallel coordinates. The algorithm is display independent, hence it can be applied to very large in size and number of variables datasets. Though it is instructive to present the results visually, the input size is no longer display-limited as for visual data mining."
Chameleon: an interactive texture-based rendering framework for visualizing three-dimensional vector fields,2003,Vis,9.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this paper we present an interactive texture-based technique for visualizing three-dimensional vector fields. The goal of the algorithm is to provide a general volume rendering framework allowing the user to compute three-dimensional flow textures interactively, and to modify the appearance of the visualization on the fly. To achieve our goal, we decouple the visualization pipeline into two disjoint stages. First, streamlines are generated from the 3D vector data. Various geometric properties of the streamlines are extracted and converted into a volumetric form using a hardware-assisted slice sweeping algorithm. In the second phase of the algorithm, the attributes stored in the volume are used as texture coordinates to look up an appearance texture to generate both informative and aesthetic representations of the underlying vector field. Users can change the input textures and instantaneously visualize the rendering results. With our algorithm, visualizations with enhanced structural perception using various visual cues can be rendered in real time. A myriad of existing geometry-based and texture-based visualization techniques can also be emulated."
An Automated Approach to Reasoning About Task-Oriented Insights in Responsive Visualization,2021,Vis,9.0,['recommendation'],"Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation."
VASA: Interactive Computational Steering of Large Asynchronous Simulation Pipelines for Societal Infrastructure,2014,VAST,9.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present VASA, a visual analytics platform consisting of a desktop application, a component model, and a suite of distributed simulation components for modeling the impact of societal threats such as weather, food contamination, and traffic on critical infrastructure such as supply chains, road networks, and power grids. Each component encapsulates a high-fidelity simulation model that together form an asynchronous simulation pipeline: a system of systems of individual simulations with a common data and parameter exchange format. At the heart of VASA is the Workbench, a visual analytics application providing three distinct features: (1) low-fidelity approximations of the distributed simulation components using local simulation proxies to enable analysts to interactively configure a simulation run; (2) computational steering mechanisms to manage the execution of individual simulation components; and (3) spatiotemporal and interactive methods to explore the combined results of a simulation run. We showcase the utility of the platform using examples involving supply chains during a hurricane as well as food contamination in a fast food restaurant chain."
Visual Analysis of Patterns in Multiple Amino Acid Mutation Graphs,2014,VAST,8.0,['agents'],"Proteins are essential parts in all living organisms. They consist of sequences of amino acids. An interaction with reactive agent can stimulate a mutation at a specific position in the sequence. This mutation may set off a chain reaction, which effects other amino acids in the protein. Chain reactions need to be analyzed, as they may invoke unwanted side effects in drug treatment. A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose. We present a new system for the search and the exploration of frequent patterns (i.e., motifs) in mutation graphs. We present a fast pattern search algorithm specifically developed for finding biologically relevant patterns in many mutation graphs (i.e., many labeled acyclic directed graphs). Our visualization system allows an interactive exploration and comparison of the found patterns. It enables locating the found patterns in the mutation graphs and in the 3D protein structures. In this way, potentially interesting patterns can be discovered. These patterns serve as starting point for a further biological analysis. In cooperation with biologists, we use our approach for analyzing a real world data set based on multiple HIV protease sequences."
VIRD: Immersive Match Video Analysis for High-Performance Badminton Coaching,2023,Vis,8.0,['pipeline automation'],"Badminton is a fast-paced sport that requires a strategic combination of spatial, temporal, and technical tactics. To gain a competitive edge at high-level competitions, badminton professionals frequently analyze match videos to gain insights and develop game strategies. However, the current process for analyzing matches is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual note-taking, due to the lack of automatic data collection and appropriate visualization tools. As a result, there is a gap in effectively analyzing matches and communicating insights among badminton coaches and players. This work proposes an end-to-end immersive match analysis pipeline designed in close collaboration with badminton professionals, including Olympic and national coaches and players. We present VIRD, a VR Bird (i.e., shuttle) immersive analysis tool, that supports interactive badminton game analysis in an immersive environment based on 3D reconstructed game views of the match video. We propose a top-down analytic workflow that allows users to seamlessly move from a high-level match overview to a detailed game view of individual rallies and shots, using situated 3D visualizations and video. We collect 3D spatial and dynamic shot data and player poses with computer vision models and visualize them in VR. Through immersive visualizations, coaches can interactively analyze situated spatial data (player positions, poses, and shot trajectories) with flexible viewpoints while navigating between shots and rallies effectively with embodied interaction. We evaluated the usefulness of VIRD with Olympic and national-level coaches and players in real matches. Results show that immersive analytics supports effective badminton match analysis with reduced context-switching costs and enhances spatial understanding with a high sense of presence."
FoVolNet: Fast Volume Rendering using Foveated Deep Neural Networks,2022,Vis,8.0,['pipeline automation'],"Volume data is found in many important scientific and engineering applications. Rendering this data for visualization at high quality and interactive rates for demanding applications such as virtual reality is still not easily achievable even using professional-grade hardware. We introduce FoVolNet—a method to significantly increase the performance of volume data visualization. We develop a cost-effective foveated rendering pipeline that sparsely samples a volume around a focal point and reconstructs the full-frame using a deep neural network. Foveated rendering is a technique that prioritizes rendering computations around the user's focal point. This approach leverages properties of the human visual system, thereby saving computational resources when rendering data in the periphery of the user's field of vision. Our reconstruction network combines direct and kernel prediction methods to produce fast, stable, and perceptually convincing output. With a slim design and the use of quantization, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural reconstruction techniques in both end-to-end frame times and visual quality. We conduct extensive evaluations of the system's rendering performance, inference speed, and perceptual properties, and we provide comparisons to competing neural image reconstruction techniques. Our test results show that FoVolNet consistently achieves significant time saving over conventional rendering while preserving perceptual quality."
Diverse Interaction Recommendation for Public Users Exploring Multi-view Visualization using Deep Learning,2022,Vis,8.0,"['recommendation', 'mixed-initiative']","Interaction is an important channel to offer users insights in interactive visualization systems. However, which interaction to operate and which part of data to explore are hard questions for public users facing a multi-view visualization for the first time. Making these decisions largely relies on professional experience and analytic abilities, which is a huge challenge for non-professionals. To solve the problem, we propose a method aiming to provide diverse, insightful, and real-time interaction recommendations for novice users. Building on the Long-Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) structure, our model captures users' interactions and visual states and encodes them in numerical vectors to make further recommendations. Through an illustrative example of a visualization system about Chinese poets in the museum scenario, the model is proven to be workable in systems with multi-views and multiple interaction types. A further user study demonstrates the method's capability to help public users conduct more insightful and diverse interactive explorations and gain more accurate data insights."
Comparison Conundrum and the Chamber of Visualizations: An Exploration of How Language Influences Visual Design,2022,Vis,8.0,['recommendation'],"The language for expressing comparisons is often complex and nuanced, making supporting natural language-based visual comparison a non-trivial task. To better understand how people reason about comparisons in natural language, we explore a design space of utterances for comparing data entities. We identified different parameters of comparison utterances that indicate what is being compared (i.e., data variables and attributes) as well as how these parameters are specified (i.e., explicitly or implicitly). We conducted a user study with sixteen data visualization experts and non-experts to investigate how they designed visualizations for comparisons in our design space. Based on the rich set of visualization techniques observed, we extracted key design features from the visualizations and synthesized them into a subset of sixteen representative visualization designs. We then conducted a follow-up study to validate user preferences for the sixteen representative visualizations corresponding to utterances in our design space. Findings from these studies suggest guidelines and future directions for designing natural language interfaces and recommendation tools to better support natural language comparisons in visual analytics."
MEDLEY: Intent-based Recommendations to Support Dashboard Composition,2022,Vis,8.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Despite the ever-growing popularity of dashboards across a wide range of domains, their authoring still remains a tedious and complex process. Current tools offer considerable support for creating individual visualizations but provide limited support for discovering groups of visualizations that can be collectively useful for composing analytic dashboards. To address this problem, we present Medley, a mixed-initiative interface that assists in dashboard composition by recommending dashboard collections (i.e., a logically grouped set of views and filtering widgets) that map to specific analytical intents. Users can specify dashboard intents (namely, measure analysis, change analysis, category analysis, or distribution analysis) explicitly through an input panel in the interface or implicitly by selecting data attributes and views of interest. The system recommends collections based on these analytic intents, and views and widgets can be selected to compose a variety of dashboards. Medley also provides a lightweight direct manipulation interface to configure interactions between views in a dashboard. Based on a study with 13 participants performing both targeted and open-ended tasks, we discuss how Medley's recommendations guide dashboard composition and facilitate different user workflows. Observations from the study identify potential directions for future work, including combining manual view specification with dashboard recommendations and designing natural language interfaces for dashboard authoring."
InkPlanner: Supporting Prewriting via Intelligent Visual Diagramming,2018,VAST,8.0,['recommendation'],"Prewriting is the process of generating and organizing ideas before drafting a document. Although often overlooked by novice writers and writing tool developers, prewriting is a critical process that improves the quality of a final document. To better understand current prewriting practices, we first conducted interviews with writing learners and experts. Based on the learners' needs and experts' recommendations, we then designed and developed InkPlanner, a novel pen and touch visualization tool that allows writers to utilize visual diagramming for ideation during prewriting. InkPlanner further allows writers to sort their ideas into a logical and sequential narrative by using a novel widget- NarrativeLine. Using a NarrativeLine, InkPlanner can automatically generate a document outline to guide later drafting exercises. Inkplanner is powered by machine-generated semantic and structural suggestions that are curated from various texts. To qualitatively review the tool and understand how writers use InkPlanner for prewriting, two writing experts were interviewed and a user study was conducted with university students. The results demonstrated that InkPlanner encouraged writers to generate more diverse ideas and also enabled them to think more strategically about how to organize their ideas for later drafting."
VisMatchmaker: Cooperation of the User and the Computer in Centralized Matching Adjustment,2016,VAST,8.0,"['recommendation', 'agents']","Centralized matching is a ubiquitous resource allocation problem. In a centralized matching problem, each agent has a preference list ranking the other agents and a central planner is responsible for matching the agents manually or with an algorithm. While algorithms can find a matching which optimizes some performance metrics, they are used as a black box and preclude the central planner from applying his domain knowledge to find a matching which aligns better with the user tasks. Furthermore, the existing matching visualization techniques (i.e. bipartite graph and adjacency matrix) fail in helping the central planner understand the differences between matchings. In this paper, we present VisMatchmaker, a visualization system which allows the central planner to explore alternatives to an algorithm-generated matching. We identified three common tasks in the process of matching adjustment: problem detection, matching recommendation and matching evaluation. We classified matching comparison into three levels and designed visualization techniques for them, including the number line view and the stacked graph view. Two types of algorithmic support, namely direct assignment and range search, and their interactive operations are also provided to enable the user to apply his domain knowledge in matching adjustment."
A Fractional Cartesian Composition Model for Semi-Spatial Comparative Visualization Design,2016,SciVis,8.0,['pipeline automation'],"The study of spatial data ensembles leads to substantial visualization challenges in a variety of applications. In this paper, we present a model for comparative visualization that supports the design of according ensemble visualization solutions by partial automation. We focus on applications, where the user is interested in preserving selected spatial data characteristics of the data as much as possible-even when many ensemble members should be jointly studied using comparative visualization. In our model, we separate the design challenge into a minimal set of user-specified parameters and an optimization component for the automatic configuration of the remaining design variables. We provide an illustrated formal description of our model and exemplify our approach in the context of several application examples from different domains in order to demonstrate its generality within the class of comparative visualization problems for spatial data ensembles."
Predicate-Based Focus-and-Context Visualization for 3D Ultrasound,2014,SciVis,8.0,['pipeline automation'],"Direct volume visualization techniques offer powerful insight into volumetric medical images and are part of the clinical routine for many applications. Up to now, however, their use is mostly limited to tomographic imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. With very few exceptions, such as fetal ultrasound, classic volume rendering using one-dimensional intensity-based transfer functions fails to yield satisfying results in case of ultrasound volumes. This is particularly due its gradient-like nature, a high amount of noise and speckle, and the fact that individual tissue types are rather characterized by a similar texture than by similar intensity values. Therefore, clinicians still prefer to look at 2D slices extracted from the ultrasound volume. In this work, we present an entirely novel approach to the classification and compositing stage of the volume rendering pipeline, specifically designed for use with ultrasonic images. We introduce point predicates as a generic formulation for integrating the evaluation of not only low-level information like local intensity or gradient, but also of high-level information, such as non-local image features or even anatomical models. Thus, we can successfully filter clinically relevant from non-relevant information. In order to effectively reduce the potentially high dimensionality of the predicate configuration space, we propose the predicate histogram as an intuitive user interface. This is augmented by a scribble technique to provide a comfortable metaphor for selecting predicates of interest. Assigning importance factors to the predicates allows for focus-and-context visualization that ensures to always show important (focus) regions of the data while maintaining as much context information as possible. Our method naturally integrates into standard ray casting algorithms and yields superior results in comparison to traditional methods in terms of visualizing a specific target anatomy in ultrasound volumes."
Multiresolution compression and reconstruction,1997,Vis,7.0,['pipeline automation'],"The paper presents a framework for multiresolution compression and geometric reconstruction of arbitrarily dimensioned data designed for distributed applications. Although being restricted to uniform sampled data, the versatile approach enables the handling of a large variety of real world elements. Examples include nonparametric, parametric and implicit lines, surfaces or volumes, all of which are common to large scale data sets. The framework is based on two fundamental steps: compression is carried out by a remote server and generates a bit-stream transmitted over the underlying network. Geometric reconstruction is performed by the local client and renders a piecewise linear approximation of the data. More precisely, the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients. In addition, geometric constraints such as boundary lines can be compressed in a lossless manner and are incorporated into the resulting bit-stream. The reconstruction pipeline performs a piecewise adaptive linear approximation of data using a fast and easy to use point removal strategy which works with any subsequent triangulation technique."
EgoNetCloud: Event-based egocentric dynamic network visualization,2015,VAST,7.0,['pipeline automation'],"Event-based egocentric dynamic networks are an important class of networks widely seen in many domains. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for these networks by combining data-driven network simplifications with a novel visualization design - EgoNetCloud. In particular, an integrated data processing pipeline is proposed to prune, compress and filter the networks into smaller but salient abstractions. To accommodate the simplified network into the visual design, we introduce a constrained graph layout algorithm on the dynamic network. Through a real-life case study as well as conversations with the domain expert, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoNetCloud design and system in completing analysis tasks on event-based dynamic networks. The user study comparing EgoNetCloud with a working system on academic search confirms the effectiveness and convenience of our visual analytics based approach."
Dead or Alive: Continuous Data Profiling for Interactive Data Science,2023,Vis,7.0,['pipeline automation'],"Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (“live”) and the other updates only on demand (“dead”). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support."
Socrates: Data Story Generation via Adaptive Machine-Guided Elicitation of User Feedback,2023,Vis,7.0,['agents'],"Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work."
GenoREC: A Recommendation System for Interactive Genomics Data Visualization,2022,Vis,7.0,['recommendation'],"Interpretation of genomics data is critically reliant on the application of a wide range of visualization tools. A large number of visualization techniques for genomics data and different analysis tasks pose a significant challenge for analysts: which visualization technique is most likely to help them generate insights into their data? Since genomics analysts typically have limited training in data visualization, their choices are often based on trial and error or guided by technical details, such as data formats that a specific tool can load. This approach prevents them from making effective visualization choices for the many combinations of data types and analysis questions they encounter in their work. Visualization recommendation systems assist non-experts in creating data visualization by recommending appropriate visualizations based on the data and task characteristics. However, existing visualization recommendation systems are not designed to handle domain-specific problems. To address these challenges, we designed GenoREC, a novel visualization recommendation system for genomics. GenoREC enables genomics analysts to select effective visualizations based on a description of their data and analysis tasks. Here, we present the recommendation model that uses a knowledge-based method for choosing appropriate visualizations and a web application that enables analysts to input their requirements, explore recommended visualizations, and export them for their usage. Furthermore, we present the results of two user studies demonstrating that GenoREC recommends visualizations that are both accepted by domain experts and suited to address the given genomics analysis problem. All supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/y73pt/."
Semantic Snapping for Guided Multi-View Visualization Design,2021,Vis,7.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is “aligned” with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach."
Loon: Using Exemplars to Visualize Large-Scale Microscopy Data,2021,Vis,7.0,['pipeline automation'],"Which drug is most promising for a cancer patient? A new microscopy-based approach for measuring the mass of individual cancer cells treated with different drugs promises to answer this question in only a few hours. However, the analysis pipeline for extracting data from these images is still far from complete automation: human intervention is necessary for quality control for preprocessing steps such as segmentation, adjusting filters, removing noise, and analyzing the result. To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach for choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient."
A Visual Voting Framework for Weather Forecast Calibration,2015,SciVis,7.0,['pipeline automation'],"Numerical weather predictions have been widely used for weather forecasting. Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system."
"Cooperative, computer-aided design of scientific visualizations",1991,Vis,6.0,['pipeline automation'],"Partial automation of the task of designing graphical displays that effectively depict the data to be visualized through cooperative computer-aided design (CCAD) is described. This paradigm combines the strengths of manual and automated design by interspersing guiding design operations by the human user with the exploration of design alternatives by the computer. The approach is demonstrated in the context of the IVE design system, a CCAD environment for the design of scientific visualizations using a set of design rules that combine primitive visualization components in different ways. These alternatives are presented graphically to the user, who can browse through them, select the most promising visualization, and refine it manually.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;"
Revealing the Semantics of Data Wrangling Scripts With Comantics,2022,Vis,6.0,['pipeline automation'],"Data workers usually seek to understand the semantics of data wrangling scripts in various scenarios, such as code debugging, reusing, and maintaining. However, the understanding is challenging for novice data workers due to the variety of programming languages, functions, and parameters. Based on the observation that differences between input and output tables highly relate to the type of data transformation, we outline a design space including 103 characteristics to describe table differences. Then, we develop Comantics, a three-step pipeline that automatically detects the semantics of data transformation scripts. The first step focuses on the detection of table differences for each line of wrangling code. Second, we incorporate a characteristic-based component and a Siamese convolutional neural network-based component for the detection of transformation types. Third, we derive the parameters of each data transformation by employing a “slot filling” strategy. We design experiments to evaluate the performance of Comantics. Further, we assess its flexibility using three example applications in different domains."
A Design Space for Surfacing Content Recommendations in Visual Analytic Platforms,2022,Vis,6.0,['recommendation'],"Recommendation algorithms have been leveraged in various ways within visualization systems to assist users as they perform of a range of information tasks. One common focus for these techniques has been the recommendation of content, rather than visual form, as a means to assist users in the identification of information that is relevant to their task context. A wide variety of techniques have been proposed to address this general problem, with a range of design choices in how these solutions surface relevant information to users. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in how visualization systems surface recommended content to users during users' visual analysis; introduces a four-dimensional design space for visual content recommendation based on a characterization of prior work; and discusses key observations regarding common patterns and future research opportunities."
Studying Early Decision Making with Progressive Bar Charts,2022,Vis,6.0,['pipeline automation'],"We conduct a user study to quantify and compare user performance for a value comparison task using four bar chart designs, where the bars show the mean values of data loaded progressively and updated every second (progressive bar charts). Progressive visualization divides different stages of the visualization pipeline—data loading, processing, and visualization—into iterative animated steps to limit the latency when loading large amounts of data. An animated visualization appearing quickly, unfolding, and getting more accurate with time, enables users to make early decisions. However, intermediate mean estimates are computed only on partial data and may not have time to converge to the true means, potentially misleading users and resulting in incorrect decisions. To address this issue, we propose two new designs visualizing the history of values in progressive bar charts, in addition to the use of confidence intervals. We comparatively study four progressive bar chart designs: with/without confidence intervals, and using near-history representation with/without confidence intervals, on three realistic data distributions. We evaluate user performance based on the percentage of correct answers (accuracy), response time, and user confidence. Our results show that, overall, users can make early and accurate decisions with 92% accuracy using only 18% of the data, regardless of the design. We find that our proposed bar chart design with only near-history is comparable to bar charts with only confidence intervals in performance, and the qualitative feedback we received indicates a preference for designs with history."
Visualization of Human Spine Biomechanics for Spinal Surgery,2020,SciVis,6.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a visualization application, designed for the exploration of human spine simulation data. Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. $\mathrm{By}$ linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. $\mathrm{in}$ a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures."
Reconstruction and Visualization of Coordinated 3D Cell Migration Based on Optical Flow,2015,SciVis,6.0,['pipeline automation'],"Animal development is marked by the repeated reorganization of cells and cell populations, which ultimately determine form and shape of the growing organism. One of the central questions in developmental biology is to understand precisely how cells reorganize, as well as how and to what extent this reorganization is coordinated. While modern microscopes can record video data for every cell during animal development in 3D+t, analyzing these videos remains a major challenge: reconstruction of comprehensive cell tracks turned out to be very demanding especially with decreasing data quality and increasing cell densities. In this paper, we present an analysis pipeline for coordinated cellular motions in developing embryos based on the optical flow of a series of 3D images. We use numerical integration to reconstruct cellular long-term motions in the optical flow of the video, we take care of data validation, and we derive a LIC-based, dense flow visualization for the resulting pathlines. This approach allows us to handle low video quality such as noisy data or poorly separated cells, and it allows the biologists to get a comprehensive understanding of their data by capturing dynamic growth processes in stills. We validate our methods using three videos of growing fruit fly embryos."
Efficient point-based isosurface exploration using the span-triangle,2004,Vis,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"We introduce a novel span-triangle data structure, based on the span-space representation for isosurfaces. It stores all necessary cell information for dynamic manipulation of the isovalue in an efficient way. We have found that using our data structure in combination with point-based techniques, implemented on graphics hardware, effects in real-time rendering and exploration. Our extraction algorithm utilizes an incremental and progressive update scheme, enabling smooth interaction without significant latency. Moreover, the corresponding visualization pipeline is capable of processing large data sets by utilizing all three levels of memory: disk, system and graphics. We address practical usability in actual medical applications, achieving a new level of interactivity."
Visualization of large terrains in resource-limited computing environments,1997,Vis,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"The authors describe a software system supporting interactive visualization of large terrains in a resource-limited environment, i.e. a low-end client computer accessing a large terrain database server through a low-bandwidth network. By ""large"", they mean that the size of the terrain database is orders of magnitude larger than the computer RAM. Superior performance is achieved by manipulating both geometric and texture data at a continuum of resolutions, and, at any given moment, using the best resolution dictated by the CPU and bandwidth constraints. The geometry is maintained as a Delaunay triangulation of a dynamic subset of the terrain data points, and the texture compressed by a progressive wavelet scheme. A careful blend of algorithmic techniques enables the system to achieve superior rendering performance on a low-end computer by optimizing the number of polygons and texture pixels sent to the graphics pipeline. It guarantees a frame rate depending only on the size and quality of the rendered image, independent of the viewing parameters and scene database size. An efficient paging scheme minimizes data I/O, thus enabling the use of the system in a low-bandwidth client/server data-streaming scenario, such as on the Internet."
Segue: Overviewing Evolution Patterns of Egocentric Networks by Interactive Construction of Spatial Layouts,2018,VAST,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"Getting the overall picture of how a large number of ego-networks evolve is a common yet challenging task. Existing techniques often require analysts to inspect the evolution patterns of ego-networks one after another. In this study, we explore an approach that allows analysts to interactively create spatial layouts in which each dot is a dynamic ego-network. These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions. Based on this transformation pipeline, we develop Segue, a visual analysis system that supports thorough exploration of the evolution patterns of ego-networks. Through two usage scenarios, we demonstrate how analysts can gain insights into the overall evolution patterns of a large collection of ego-networks by interactively creating different spatial layouts."
An Integrated Visual Analysis System for Fusing MR Spectroscopy and Multi-Modal Radiology Imaging,2014,VAST,5.0,['agents'],"For cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme, there is an increasing interest in defining ""biological target volumes"" (BTV), high tumour-burden regions which may be targeted with dose boosts in radiotherapy. The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning."
InkSight: Leveraging Sketch Interaction for Documenting Chart Findings in Computational Notebooks,2023,Vis,5.0,"['recommendation', 'mixed-initiative']","Computational notebooks have become increasingly popular for exploratory data analysis due to their ability to support data exploration and explanation within a single document. Effective documentation for explaining chart findings during the exploration process is essential as it helps recall and share data analysis. However, documenting chart findings remains a challenge due to its time-consuming and tedious nature. While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests. In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items. Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts. Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of InkSight in expressing user intent and facilitating chart finding documentation."
Let the Chart Spark: Embedding Semantic Context into Chart with Text-to-Image Generative Model,2023,Vis,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"Pictorial visualization seamlessly integrates data and semantic context into visual representation, conveying complex information in an engaging and informative manner. Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to their predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative models. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative models combined with an interactive interface for visualization design."
Homomorphic-Encrypted Volume Rendering,2020,SciVis,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"Computationally demanding tasks are typically calculated in dedicated data centers, and real-time visualizations also follow this trend. Some rendering tasks, however, require the highest level of confidentiality so that no other party, besides the owner, can read or see the sensitive data. Here we present a direct volume rendering approach that performs volume rendering directly on encrypted volume data by using the homomorphic Paillier encryption algorithm. This approach ensures that the volume data and rendered image are uninterpretable to the rendering server. Our volume rendering pipeline introduces novel approaches for encrypted-data compositing, interpolation, and opacity modulation, as well as simple transfer function design, where each of these routines maintains the highest level of privacy. We present performance and memory overhead analysis that is associated with our privacy-preserving scheme. Our approach is open and secure by design, as opposed to secure through obscurity. Owners of the data only have to keep their secure key confidential to guarantee the privacy of their volume data and the rendered images. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first privacy-preserving remote volume-rendering approach that does not require that any server involved be trustworthy; even in cases when the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked to a foreign party."
GenerativeMap: Visualization and Exploration of Dynamic Density Maps via Generative Learning Model,2019,InfoVis,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"The density map is widely used for data sampling, time-varying detection, ensemble representation, etc. The visualization of dynamic evolution is a challenging task when exploring spatiotemporal data. Many approaches have been provided to explore the variation of data patterns over time, which commonly need multiple parameters and preprocessing works. Image generation is a well-known topic in deep learning, and a variety of generating models have been promoted in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a general pipeline called GenerativeMap to extract dynamics of density maps by generating interpolation information. First, a trained generative model comprises an important part of our approach, which can generate nonlinear and natural results by implementing a few parameters. Second, a visual presentation is proposed to show the density change, which is combined with the level of detail and blue noise sampling for a better visual effect. Third, for dynamic visualization of large-scale density maps, we extend this approach to show the evolution in regions of interest, which costs less to overcome the drawback of the learning-based generative model. We demonstrate our method on different types of cases, and we evaluate and compare the approach from multiple aspects. The results help identify the effectiveness of our approach and confirm its applicability in different scenarios."
Scalable Topological Data Analysis and Visualization for Evaluating Data-Driven Models in Scientific Applications,2019,VAST,5.0,['pipeline automation'],"With the rapid adoption of machine learning techniques for large-scale applications in science and engineering comes the convergence of two grand challenges in visualization. First, the utilization of black box models (e.g., deep neural networks) calls for advanced techniques in exploring and interpreting model behaviors. Second, the rapid growth in computing has produced enormous datasets that require techniques that can handle millions or more samples. Although some solutions to these interpretability challenges have been proposed, they typically do not scale beyond thousands of samples, nor do they provide the high-level intuition scientists are looking for. Here, we present the first scalable solution to explore and analyze high-dimensional functions often encountered in the scientific data analysis pipeline. By combining a new streaming neighborhood graph construction, the corresponding topology computation, and a novel data aggregation scheme, namely topology aware datacubes, we enable interactive exploration of both the topological and the geometric aspect of high-dimensional data. Following two use cases from high-energy-density (HED) physics and computational biology, we demonstrate how these capabilities have led to crucial new insights in both applications."
Voxels on fire,2003,Vis,4.0,['pipeline automation'],We introduce a method for the animation of fire propagation and the burning consumption of objects represented as volumetric data sets. Our method uses a volumetric fire propagation model based on an enhanced distance field. It can simulate the spreading of multiple fire fronts over a specified isosurface without actually having to create that isosurface. The distance field is generated from a specific shell volume that rapidly creates narrow spatial bands around the virtual surface of any given isovalue. The complete distance field is then obtained by propagation from the initial bands. At each step multiple fire fronts can evolve simultaneously on the volumetric object. The flames of the fire are constructed from streams of particles whose movement is regulated by a velocity field generated with the hardware-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM). The LBM provides a physically-based simulation of the air flow around the burning object. The object voxels and the splats associated with the flame particles are rendered in the same pipeline so that the volume data with its external and internal structures can be displayed along with the fire.
IStar: A Raster Representation for Scalable Image and Volume Data,2007,Vis,4.0,['pipeline automation'],"Topology has been an important tool for analyzing scalar data and flow fields in visualization. In this work, we analyze the topology of multivariate image and volume data sets with discontinuities in order to create an efficient, raster-based representation we call IStar. Specifically, the topology information is used to create a dual structure that contains nodes and connectivity information for every segmentable region in the original data set. This graph structure, along with a sampled representation of the segmented data set, is embedded into a standard raster image which can then be substantially downsampled and compressed. During rendering, the raster image is upsampled and the dual graph is used to reconstruct the original function. Unlike traditional raster approaches, our representation can preserve sharp discontinuities at any level of magnification, much like scalable vector graphics. However, because our representation is raster-based, it is well suited to the real-time rendering pipeline. We demonstrate this by reconstructing our data sets on graphics hardware at real-time rates."
Scientific visualization of water quality in the Chesapeake bay,2000,Vis,3.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper describes our experience in designing and building a tool for visualizing the results of the CE-QUAL-ICM Three-Dimensional Eutrophication Model, as applied to water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. This model outputs a highly multidimensional dataset over very many timesteps – outstripping the capabilities of the visualization tools available to the research team. As part of the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Programming Environment and Training (PET) project, a special visualization tool was developed. Some problematic issues in efficiently handling and processing the data format from the computational model were resolved through this work. Also, a sophisticated system for dynamically generating visualizations of the data has been implemented. In addition, the development of the VisGen library allows for high-level, flexible control of the VTK graphics pipeline. Coupled with an easy-to-use interface to the application, this allows the user a lot of control over the graphical representation of the data. Once the user has a representation he/she is pleased with, a wide variety of options are provided for how this can be used in presentation, or for sharing with remote colleagues. This paper includes discussions on how the simulation data are handled efficiently, as well as how the issues of usability, flexibility and collaboration are addressed."
FastSplats: optimized splatting on rectilinear grids,2000,Vis,3.0,['pipeline automation'],"Splatting is widely applied in many areas, including volume, point-based and image-based rendering. Improvements to splatting, such as eliminating popping and color bleeding, occasion-based acceleration, post-rendering classification and shading, have all been recently accomplished. These improvements share a common need for efficient frame-buffer accesses. We present an optimized software splatting package, using a newly designed primitive, called FastSplat, to scan-convert footprints. Our approach does not use texture mapping hardware, but supports the whole pipeline in memory. In such an integrated pipeline, we are then able to study the optimization strategies and address image quality issues. While this research is meant for a study of the inherent trade-off of splatting, our renderer, purely in software, achieves 3- to 5-fold speedups over a top-end texture hardware implementation (for opaque data sets). We further propose a method of efficient occlusion culling using a summed area table of opacity. 3D solid texturing and bump mapping capabilities are demonstrated to show the flexibility of such an integrated rendering pipeline. A detailed numerical error analysis, in addition to the performance and storage issues, is also presented. Our approach requires low storage and uses simple operations. Thus, it is easily implementable in hardware."
ALIDA: Using machine learning for intent discernment in visual analytics interfaces,2010,VAST,3.0,['agents'],"In this paper, we introduce ALIDA, an Active Learning Intent Discerning Agent for visual analytics interfaces. As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view. Current work has tested ALIDA under the exploration of homonyms for users wishing to explore word linkages within a dictionary. Ongoing work includes using ALIDA to guide users in transfer function design for volume rendering within scientific gateways."
From Information to Choice: A Critical Inquiry Into Visualization Tools for Decision Making,2023,Vis,3.0,['pipeline automation'],"In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information (intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations aid in the “intelligence” stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other decision making stages, namely “design” and “choice”? To further explore this question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility I evels. Our curated list of the 88 surveyed visualization tools is available in the OSF link (https://osf.io/nrasz/?view_only=b92a90a34ae241449b5f2cd33383bfcb)."
VizSnippets: Compressing Visualization Bundles Into Representative Previews for Browsing Visualization Collections,2021,Vis,3.0,['pipeline automation'],"Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or Power Bl, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles. Result snippets, compact previews of these bundles, are presented to users to help them identify relevant content when browsing collections. Our engagement with Tableau product teams and review of existing snippet designs on five platforms showed us that current practices fail to help people judge the relevance of bundles because they include only the title and one image. Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen keywords. We also reflect on the method of visual inspection through random sampling to gain confidence in model and parameter choices."
Visualization of Flow Behavior in Earth Mantle Convection,2012,SciVis,3.0,['pipeline automation'],"A fundamental characteristic of fluid flow is that it causes mixing: introduce a dye into a flow, and it will disperse. Mixing can be used as a method to visualize and characterize flow. Because mixing is a process that occurs over time, it is a 4D problem that presents a challenge for computation, visualization, and analysis. Motivated by a mixing problem in geophysics, we introduce a combination of methods to analyze, transform, and finally visualize mixing in simulations of convection in a self-gravitating 3D spherical shell representing convection in the Earth's mantle. Geophysicists use tools such as the finite element model CitcomS to simulate convection, and introduce massless, passive tracers to model mixing. The output of geophysical flow simulation is hard to analyze for domain experts because of overall data size and complexity. In addition, information overload and occlusion are problems when visualizing a whole-earth model. To address the large size of the data, we rearrange the simulation data using intelligent indexing for fast file access and efficient caching. To address information overload and interpret mixing, we compute tracer concentration statistics, which are used to characterize mixing in mantle convection models. Our visualization uses a specially tailored version of Direct Volume Rendering. The most important adjustment is the use of constant opacity. Because of this special area of application, i. e. the rendering of a spherical shell, many computations for volume rendering can be optimized. These optimizations are essential to a smooth animation of the time-dependent simulation data. Our results show how our system can be used to quickly assess the simulation output and test hypotheses regarding Earth's mantle convection. The integrated processing pipeline helps geoscientists to focus on their main task of analyzing mantle homogenization."
Distributed data management for large volume visualization,2005,Vis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"We propose a distributed data management scheme for large data visualization that emphasizes efficient data sharing and access. To minimize data access time and support users with a variety of local computing capabilities, we introduce an adaptive data selection method based on an ""enhanced time-space partitioning"" (ETSP) tree that assists with effective visibility culling, as well as multiresolution data selection. By traversing the tree, our data management algorithm can quickly identify the visible regions of data, and, for each region, adaptively choose the lowest resolution satisfying user-specified error tolerances. Only necessary data elements are accessed and sent to the visualization pipeline. To further address the issue of sharing large-scale data among geographically distributed collaborative teams, we have designed an infrastructure for integrating our data management technique with a distributed data storage system provided by logistical networking (LoN). Data sets at different resolutions are generated and uploaded to LoN for wide-area access. We describe a parallel volume rendering system that verifies the effectiveness of our data storage, selection and access scheme."
Sort-middle multi-projector immediate-mode rendering in Chromium,2005,Vis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"Traditionally, sort-middle is a technique that has been difficult to attain on clusters because of the tight coupling of geometry and rasterization processes on commodity graphics hardware. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a new sort-middle approach for performing immediate-mode rendering in Chromium. The Chromium Rendering System is used extensively to drive multi-projector displays on PC clusters with inexpensive commodity graphics components. By default, Chromium uses a sort-first approach to distribute rendering work to individual nodes in a PC cluster. While this sort-first approach works effectively in retained-mode rendering, it suffers from various network bottlenecks when rendering in immediate-mode. Current techniques avoid these bottlenecks by sorting vertex data as a pre-processing step and grouping vertices into specific bounding boxes, using Chromium's bounding box extension. These steps may be expensive, especially if the dataset is dynamic. In our approach, we utilize standard programmable graphics hardware and extend standard APIs to achieve a separation in the rendering pipeline. The pre-processing of vertex data or the grouping of vertices into bounding boxes are not required. Additionally, the amount of OpenGL state commands transmitted through the network are reduced. Our results indicate that the approach can attain twice the frame rates as compared to Chromium's sort-first approach when rendering in immediate-mode."
Context-Adaptive Mobile Visualization and Information Management,2004,Vis,2.0,['agents'],"This poster abstract presents a scalable information visualization system for mobile devices and desktop systems. It is designed to support the operation and the workflow of wastewater systems. The regarded information data includes general information about buildings and units, process data, occupational safety regulations, work directions and first aid instructions in case of an accident. Technically, the presented framework combines visualization with agent technology in order to automatically scale various visualization types to fit on different platforms like PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) or Tablet PCs. The implementation is based on but not limited to SQL, JSP, HTML and VRML."
Automation or interaction: what's best for big data?,1999,Vis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],
Nonpolygonal isosurface rendering for large volume datasets,1994,Vis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"Surface-based rendering techniques, particularly those that extract a polygonal approximation of an isosurface, are widely used in volume visualization. As dataset size increases though, the computational demands of these methods can overwhelm typically available computing resources. Recent work on accelerating such techniques has focused on preprocessing the volume data or postprocessing the extracted polygonization. The algorithm presented, concentrates instead on streamlining the surface extraction process itself so as to accelerate the rendering of large volumes. The technique shortens the conventional isosurface visualization pipeline by eliminating the intermediate polygonization. We compute the contribution of the isosurface within a volume cell to the resulting image directly from a simplified numerical description of the cell/surface intersection. The approach also reduces the work in the remaining stages of the visualization process. By quantizing the volume data, we exploit precomputed and cached data at key processing steps to improve rendering efficiency. The resulting implementation provides comparatively fast renderings with reasonable image quality.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;"
Mystique: Deconstructing SVG Charts for Layout Reuse,2023,Vis,2.0,['mixed-initiative'],"To facilitate the reuse of existing charts, previous research has examined how to obtain a semantic understanding of a chart by deconstructing its visual representation into reusable components, such as encodings. However, existing deconstruction approaches primarily focus on chart styles, handling only basic layouts. In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones, as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions."
Supporting Guided Exploratory Visual Analysis on Time Series Data with Reinforcement Learning,2023,Vis,2.0,['agents'],"The exploratory visual analysis (EVA) of time series data uses visualization as the main output medium and input interface for exploring new data. However, for users who lack visual analysis expertise, interpreting and manipulating EVA can be challenging. Thus, providing guidance on EVA is necessary and two relevant questions need to be answered. First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data. As a user uploads a time series dataset, Visail can generate step-by-step EVA suggestions, while each step is visualized as an annotated chart combined with textual descriptions. The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted an ablation study, a user study, and two case studies. The results of our evaluation suggested that Visail can provide effective guidance on supporting EVA on time series data."
A Computational Design Pipeline to Fabricate Sensing Network Physicalizations,2023,Vis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"Interaction is critical for data analysis and sensemaking. However, designing interactive physicalizations is challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. Interactive physicalizations are typically produced in an unstructured manner, resulting in unique solutions for a specific dataset, problem, or interaction that cannot be easily extended or adapted to new scenarios or future physicalizations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a computational design pipeline to 3D print network physicalizations with integrated sensing capabilities. Networks are ubiquitous, yet their complex geometry also requires significant engineering considerations to provide intuitive, effective interactions for exploration. Using our pipeline, designers can readily produce network physicalizations supporting selection—the most critical atomic operation for interaction—by touch through capacitive sensing and computational inference. Our computational design pipeline introduces a new design paradigm by concurrently considering the form and interactivity of a physicalization into one cohesive fabrication workflow. We evaluate our approach using (i) computational evaluations, (ii) three usage scenarios focusing on general visualization tasks, and (iii) expert interviews. The design paradigm introduced by our pipeline can lower barriers to physicalization research, creation, and adoption."
Roses Have Thorns: Understanding the Downside of Oncological Care Delivery Through Visual Analytics and Sequential Rule Mining,2023,Vis,2.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Personalized head and neck cancer therapeutics have greatly improved survival rates for patients, but are often leading to understudied long-lasting symptoms which affect quality of life. Sequential rule mining (SRM) is a promising unsupervised machine learning method for predicting longitudinal patterns in temporal data which, however, can output many repetitive patterns that are difficult to interpret without the assistance of visual analytics. We present a data-driven, human-machine analysis visual system developed in collaboration with SRM model builders in cancer symptom research, which facilitates mechanistic knowledge discovery in large scale, multivariate cohort symptom data. Our system supports multivariate predictive modeling of post-treatment symptoms based on during-treatment symptoms. It supports this goal through an SRM, clustering, and aggregation back end, and a custom front end to help develop and tune the predictive models. The system also explains the resulting predictions in the context of therapeutic decisions typical in personalized care delivery. We evaluate the resulting models and system with an interdisciplinary group of modelers and head and neck oncology researchers. The results demonstrate that our system effectively supports clinical and symptom research."
Average Estimates in Line Graphs Are Biased Toward Areas of Higher Variability,2023,Vis,2.0,['recommendation'],"We investigate variability overweighting, a previously undocumented bias in line graphs, where estimates of average value are biased toward areas of higher variability in that line. We found this effect across two preregistered experiments with 140 and 420 participants. These experiments also show that the bias is reduced when using a dot encoding of the same series. We can model the bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn along the line. This bias might arise because higher variability leads to stronger weighting in the average calculation, either due to the longer line segments (even though those segments contain the same number of data values) or line segments with higher variability being otherwise more visually salient. Understanding and predicting this bias is important for visualization design guidelines, recommendation systems, and tool builders, as the bias can adversely affect estimates of averages and trends."
Too Many Cooks: Exploring How Graphical Perception Studies Influence Visualization Recommendations in Draco,2023,Vis,2.0,"['recommendation', 'pipeline automation']","Findings from graphical perception can guide visualization recommendation algorithms in identifying effective visualization designs. However, existing algorithms use knowledge from, at best, a few studies, limiting our understanding of how complementary (or contradictory) graphical perception results influence generated recommendations. In this paper, we present a pipeline of applying a large body of graphical perception results to develop new visualization recommendation algorithms and conduct an exploratory study to investigate how results from graphical perception can alter the behavior of downstream algorithms. Specifically, we model graphical perception results from 30 papers in Draco—a framework to model visualization knowledge—to develop new recommendation algorithms. By analyzing Draco-generated algorithms, we showcase the feasibility of our method to (1) identify gaps in existing graphical perception literature informing recommendation algorithms, (2) cluster papers by their preferred design rules and constraints, and (3) investigate why certain studies can dominate Draco's recommendations, whereas others may have little influence. Given our findings, we discuss the potential for mutually reinforcing advancements in graphical perception and visualization recommendation research."
The Rational Agent Benchmark for Data Visualization,2023,Vis,2.0,['agents'],"Understanding how helpful a visualization is from experimental results is difficult because the observed performance is confounded with aspects of the study design, such as how useful the information that is visualized is for the task. We develop a rational agent framework for designing and interpreting visualization experiments. Our framework conceives two experiments with the same setup: one with behavioral agents (human subjects), and the other one with a hypothetical rational agent. A visualization is evaluated by comparing the expected performance of behavioral agents to that of a rational agent under different assumptions. Using recent visualization decision studies from the literature, we demonstrate how the framework can be used to pre-experimentally evaluate the experiment design by bounding the expected improvement in performance from having access to visualizations, and post-experimentally to deconfound errors of information extraction from errors of optimization, among other analyses."
Visualization Equilibrium,2021,Vis,2.0,['agents'],"In many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions. In these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. We reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings."
IsoTrotter: Visually Guided Empirical Modelling of Atmospheric Convection,2020,SciVis,2.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Empirical models, fitted to data from observations, are often used in natural sciences to describe physical behaviour and support discoveries. However, with more complex models, the regression of parameters quickly becomes insufficient, requiring a visual parameter space analysis to understand and optimize the models. In this work, we present a design study for building a model describing atmospheric convection. We present a mixed-initiative approach to visually guided modelling, integrating an interactive visual parameter space analysis with partial automatic parameter optimization. Our approach includes a new, semi-automatic technique called IsoTrotting, where we optimize the procedure by navigating along isocontours of the model. We evaluate the model with unique observational data of atmospheric convection based on flight trajectories of paragliders."
Visilant: Visual Support for the Exploration and Analytical Process Tracking in Criminal Investigations,2020,VAST,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"The daily routine of criminal investigators consists of a thorough analysis of highly complex and heterogeneous data of crime cases. Such data can consist of case descriptions, testimonies, criminal networks, spatial and temporal information, and virtually any other data that is relevant for the case. Criminal investigators work under heavy time pressure to analyze the data for relationships, propose and verify several hypotheses, and derive conclusions, while the data can be incomplete or inconsistent and is changed and updated throughout the investigation, as new findings are added to the case. Based on a four-year intense collaboration with criminalists, we present a conceptual design for a visual tool supporting the investigation workflow and Visilant, a web-based tool for the exploration and analysis of criminal data guided by the proposed design. Visilant aims to support namely the exploratory part of the investigation pipeline, from case overview, through exploration and hypothesis generation, to the case presentation. Visilant tracks the reasoning process and as the data is changing, it informs investigators which hypotheses are affected by the data change and should be revised. The tool was evaluated by senior criminology experts within two sessions and their feedback is summarized in the paper. Additional supplementary material contains the technical details and exemplary case study."
The Effect of Data Transformations on Scalar Field Topological Analysis of High-Order FEM Solutions,2019,SciVis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"High-order finite element methods (HO-FEM) are gaining popularity in the simulation community due to their success in solving complex flow dynamics. There is an increasing need to analyze the data produced as output by these simulations. Simultaneously, topological analysis tools are emerging as powerful methods for investigating simulation data. However, most of the current approaches to topological analysis have had limited application to HO-FEM simulation data for two reasons. First, the current topological tools are designed for linear data (polynomial degree one), but the polynomial degree of the data output by these simulations is typically higher (routinely up to polynomial degree six). Second, the simulation data and derived quantities of the simulation data have discontinuities at element boundaries, and these discontinuities do not match the input requirements for the topological tools. One solution to both issues is to transform the high-order data to achieve low-order, continuous inputs for topological analysis. Nevertheless, there has been little work evaluating the possible transformation choices and their downstream effect on the topological analysis. We perform an empirical study to evaluate two commonly used data transformation methodologies along with the recently introduced L-SIAC filter for processing high-order simulation data. Our results show diverse behaviors are possible. We offer some guidance about how best to consider a pipeline of topological analysis of HO-FEM simulations with the currently available implementations of topological analysis."
Firefly: Virtual Illumination Drones for Interactive Visualization,2018,SciVis,2.0,['pipeline automation'],"Light specification in three dimensional scenes is a complex problem and several approaches have been presented that aim to automate this process. However, there are many scenarios where a static light setup is insufficient, as the scene content and camera position may change. Simultaneous manual control over the camera and light position imposes a high cognitive load on the user. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for automatic scene illumination with Fireflies. Fireflies are intelligent virtual light drones that illuminate the scene by traveling on a closed path. The Firefly path automatically adapts to changes in the scene based on an outcome-oriented energy function. To achieve interactive performance, we employ a parallel rendering pipeline for the light path evaluations. We provide a catalog of energy functions for various application scenarios and discuss the applicability of our method on several examples."
The visible radio: process visualization of a software-defined radio,2005,Vis,1.0,['pipeline automation'],"In this case study, a data-oriented approach is used to visualize a complex digital signal processing pipeline. The pipeline implements a frequency modulated (FM) software-defined radio (SDR). SDR is an emerging technology where portions of the radio hardware, such as filtering and modulation, are replaced by software components. We discuss how an SDR implementation is instrumented to illustrate the processes involved in FM transmission and reception. By using audio-encoded images, we illustrate the processes involved in radio, such as how filters are used to reduce noise, the nature of a carrier wave, and how frequency modulation acts on a signal. The visualization approach used in this work is very effective in demonstrating advanced topics in digital signal processing and is a useful tool for experimenting with the software radio design."
Holographic video display of time-series volumetric medical data,2003,Vis,1.0,['pipeline automation'],"We describe an animated electro-holographic visualization of brain lesions due to the progression of multiple sclerosis. A research case study is used which documents the expression of visible brain lesions in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes collected over the interval of one year. Some of the salient information resident within this data is described, and the motivation for using a dynamic spatial display to explore its spatial and temporal characteristics is stated. We provide a brief overview of spatial displays in medical imaging applications, and then describe our experimental visualization pipeline, from the processing of MRI datasets, through model construction, computer graphic rendering, and hologram encoding. The utility, strengths and shortcomings of the electro-holographic visualization are described and future improvements are suggested."
On-the-fly rendering of losslessly compressed irregular volume data,2000,Vis,1.0,['pipeline automation'],"Very large irregular-grid data sets are represented as tetrahedral meshes and may incur significant disk I/O access overhead in the rendering process. An effective way to alleviate the disk I/O overhead associated with rendering a large tetrahedral mesh is to reduce the I/O bandwidth requirement through compression. Existing tetrahedral mesh compression algorithms focus only on compression efficiency and cannot be readily integrated into the mesh rendering process, and thus demand that a compressed tetrahedral mesh be decompressed before it can be rendered into a 2D image. This paper presents an integrated tetrahedral mesh compression and rendering algorithm called Gatun, which allows compressed tetrahedral meshes to be rendered incrementally as they are being decompressed, thus leading to an efficient irregular grid rendering pipeline. Both compression and rendering algorithms in Gatun exploit the same local connectivity information among adjacent tetrahedra, and thus can be tightly integrated into a unified implementation framework. Our tetrahedral compression algorithm is specifically designed to facilitate the integration with an irregular grid renderer without any compromise in compression efficiency. A unique performance advantage of Gatun is its ability to reduce the runtime memory footprint requirement by releasing memory allocated to tetrahedra as early as possible."
"""Whole field modelling"". Effective real-time and post-survey visualization of underwater pipelines",1999,Vis,1.0,['pipeline automation'],"The detailed underwater bathymetric data provided by Sonar Research and Development's high speed multi-frequency sonar transducer system provides new challenges in the development of interactive seabed visualization tools. The paper introduces a ""Whole Field Modelling"" system developed at Sonar Research and Development Ltd and The Department of Computer Science, University of Hull. This system provides the viewer with a new 3D underwater visualization environment that allows the user to pilot a virtual underwater vehicle around an accurate seabed model. We consider two example case studies that use the Whole Field Modelling system for visualizing sonar data. Both case studies, visualizing real time pipeline dredging and pipe restoration visualization, are implemented using real survey data."
Towards Dataset-Scale and Feature-Oriented Evaluation of Text Summarization in Large Language Model Prompts,2024,Vis,1.0,['agents'],"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering have made chatbot customization more accessible, significantly reducing barriers to tasks that previously required programming skills. However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements for text summarization through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the effectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation of summarization prompts, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks. For future works, we advocate moving towards feature-oriented evaluation of LLM prompts and discuss unsolved challenges in terms of human-agent interaction."
KNowNEt:Guided Health Information Seeking from LLMs via Knowledge Graph Integration,2024,Vis,1.0,['agents'],"The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) for health information seeking can pose severe risks due to the potential for misinformation and the complexity of these topics. This paper introduces KnowNet a visualization system that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KG) to provide enhanced accuracy and structured exploration. Specifically, for enhanced accuracy, KnowNet extracts triples (e.g., entities and their relations) from LLM outputs and maps them into the validated information and supported evidence in external KGs. For structured exploration, KnowNet provides next-step recommendations based on the neighborhood of the currently explored entities in KGs, aiming to guide a comprehensive understanding without overlooking critical aspects. To enable reasoning with both the structured data in KGs and the unstructured outputs from LLMs, KnowNet conceptualizes the understanding of a subject as the gradual construction of graph visualization. A progressive graph visualization is introduced to monitor past inquiries, and bridge the current query with the exploration history and next-step recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via use cases and expert interviews."
VisEval: A Benchmark for Data Visualization in the Era of Large Language Models,2024,Vis,1.0,['generation'],"Translating natural language to visualization (NL2VIS) has shown great promise for visual data analysis, but it remains a challenging task that requires multiple low-level implementations, such as natural language processing and visualization design. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically scanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval provides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on a series of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challenges and delivers essential insights for future advancements."
PUREsuggest: Citation-Based Literature Search and Visual Exploration with Keyword-Controlled Rankings,2024,Vis,1.0,['recommendation'],"Citations allow quickly identifying related research. If multiple publications are selected as seeds, specific suggestions for related literature can be made based on the number of incoming and outgoing citation links to this selection. Interactively adding recommended publications to the selection refines the next suggestion and incrementally builds a relevant collection of publications. Following this approach, the paper presents a search and foraging approach, PUREsuggest, which combines citation-based suggestions with augmented visualizations of the citation network. The focus and novelty of the approach is, first, the transparency of how the rankings are explained visually and, second, that the process can be steered through user-defined keywords, which reflect topics of interests. The system can be used to build new literature collections, to update and assess existing ones, as well as to use the collected literature for identifying relevant experts in the field. We evaluated the recommendation approach through simulated sessions and performed a user study investigating search strategies and usage patterns supported by the interface."
Dupo: A Mixed-Initiative Authoring Tool for Responsive Visualization,2023,Vis,1.0,"['mixed-initiative', 'pipeline automation']","Designing responsive visualizations for various screen types can be tedious as authors must manage multiple chart versions across design iterations. Automated approaches for responsive visualization must take into account the user's need for agency in exploring possible design ideas and applying customizations based on their own goals. We design and implement Dupo, a mixedinitiative approach to creating responsive visualizations that combines the agency afforded by a manual interface with automation provided by a recommender system. Given an initial design, users can browse automated design suggestions for a different screen type and make edits to a chosen design, thereby supporting quick prototyping and customizability. Dupo employs a two-step recommender pipeline that first suggests significant design changes (Exploration) followed by more subtle changes (Alteration). We evaluated Dupo with six expert responsive visualization authors. While creating responsive versions of a source design in Dupo, participants could reason about different design suggestions without having to manually prototype them, and thus avoid prematurely fixating on a particular design. This process led participants to create designs that they were satisfied with but which they had previously overlooked."
NASA's great zooms: a case study,2002,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"This paper examines a series of NASA outreach visualizations created using several layers of remote sensing satellite data ranging from 4-kilometers per pixel to I-meter per pixel. The viewer is taken on a seamless, cloud free journey from a global view of the Earth down to ground level where buildings, streets, and cars are visible. The visualizations were produced using a procedural shader that takes advantage of accurate georegistration and color matching between images. The shader accurately and efficiently maps the data sets to geometry allowing for animations with few perceptual transitions among data sets. We developed a pipeline to facilitate the production of over twenty zoom visualizations. Millions of people have seen these visualizations through national and international media coverage."
VDQAM: A toolkit for database quality evaluation based on visual morphology,2012,VAST,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"Data quality evaluation is one of the most critical steps during the data mining processes. Data with poor quality often leads to poor performance in data mining, low efficiency in data analysis, wrong decision which bring great economic loss to users and organizations further. Although many researches have been carried out from various aspects of the extracting, transforming, and loading processes in data mining, most researches pay more attention to analysis automation than to data quality evaluation. To address the data quality evaluation issues, we propose an approach to combine human beings' powerful cognitive abilities in data quality evaluation with the high efficiency ability of computer, and develop a visual analysis method for data quality evaluation based on visual morphology."
Exploring agent-based simulations using temporal graphs,2011,VAST,0.0,['agents'],"Agent-based simulation has become a key technique for modeling and simulating dynamic, complicated behaviors in social and behavioral sciences. Lacking the appropriate tools and support, it is difficult for social scientists to thoroughly analyze the results of these simulations. In this work, we capture the complex relationships between discrete simulation states by visualizing the data as a temporal graph. In collaboration with expert analysts, we identify two graph structures which capture important relationships between pivotal states in the simulation and their inevitable outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these structures in the interactive analysis of a large-scale social science simulation of political power in present-day Thailand."
A visual navigation system for querying neural stem cell imaging data,2011,VAST,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"Cellular biology deals with studying the behavior of cells. Current time-lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells. On the other hand, these devices generate such massive amounts of data (250GB of data per experiment) that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible. In this paper we propose an end-to-end system to analyze time-lapse images of the cultures of human neural stem cells (hNSC), that includes an image processing system to analyze the images to extract all the relevant geometric and statistical features within and between images, a database management system to manage and handle queries on the data, a visual analytic system to navigate through the data, and a visual query system to explore different relationships and correlations between the parameters. In each stage of the pipeline we make novel algorithmic and conceptual contributions, and the entire system design is motivated by many different yet unanswered exploratory questions pursued by our neurobiologist collaborators. With a few examples we show how such abstract biological queries can be analyzed and answered by our system."
Large-scale neuroanatomical visualization using a manifold embedding approach,2010,VAST,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"We present a unified framework for data processing, mining and interactive visualization of large-scale neuroanatomical databases. The input data is assumed to lie in a specific atlas space, or simply exist as a separate collection. Users can specify their own atlas for comparative analyses. The original data exist as MRI images in standard formats. It is uploaded to a remote server and processed offline by a parallelized pipeline workflow. This workflow transforms the data to represent it as both volumetric and triangular mesh cortical surfaces. We use multiresolution representations to scale complexity to data storage availability as well as graphical processing performance. Our workflow implements predefined metrics for clustering and classification, and data projection schemes to aid in visualization. Additionally the system provides a visual query interface for performing selection requests based on user-defined search criteria."
Visual Support for the Loop Grafting Workflow on Proteins,2024,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"In understanding and redesigning the function of proteins in modern biochemistry, protein engineers are increasingly focusing on exploring regions in proteins called loops. Analyzing various characteristics of these regions helps the experts design the transfer of the desired function from one protein to another. This process is denoted as loop grafting. We designed a set of interactive visualizations that provide experts with visual support through all the loop grafting pipeline steps. The workflow is divided into several phases, reflecting the steps of the pipeline. Each phase is supported by a specific set of abstracted 2D visual representations of proteins and their loops that are interactively linked with the 3D View of proteins. By sequentially passing through the individual phases, the user shapes the list of loops that are potential candidates for loop grafting. Finally, the actual in-silico insertion of the loop candidates from one protein to the other is performed, and the results are visually presented to the user. In this way, the fully computational rational design of proteins and their loops results in newly designed protein structures that can be further assembled and tested through in-vitro experiments. We showcase the contribution of our visual support design on a real case scenario changing the enantiomer selectivity of the engineered enzyme. Moreover, we provide the readers with the experts' feedback."
CataAnno: An Ancient Catalog Annotator for Annotation Cleaning by Recommendation,2024,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"Classical bibliography, by researching preserved catalogs from both official archives and personal collections of accumulated books, examines the books throughout history, thereby revealing cultural development across historical periods. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to accomplish the task of data annotation concerning Chinese ancient catalogs. We introduce the CataAnno system that facilitates users in completing annotations more efficiently through cross-linked views, recommendation methods and convenient annotation interactions. The recommendation method can learn the background knowledge and annotation patterns that experts subconsciously integrate into the data during prior annotation processes. CataAnno searches for the most relevant examples previously annotated and recommends to the user. Meanwhile, the cross-linked views assist users in comprehending the correlations between entries and offer explanations for these recommendations. Evaluation and expert feedback confirm that the CataAnno system, by offering high-quality recommendations and visualizing the relationships between entries, can mitigate the necessity for specialized knowledge during the annotation process. This results in enhanced accuracy and consistency in annotations, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency."
SurroFlow: A Flow-Based Surrogate Model for Parameter Space Exploration and Uncertainty Quantification,2024,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"Existing deep learning-based surrogate models facilitate efficient data generation, but fall short in uncertainty quantification, efficient parameter space exploration, and reverse prediction. In our work, we introduce SurroFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based surrogate model, to learn the invertible transformation between simulation parameters and simulation outputs. The model not only allows accurate predictions of simulation outcomes for a given simulation parameter but also supports uncertainty quantification in the data generation process. Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter recommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm as the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble simulation exploration and visualization. Our framework significantly reduces the computational costs while enhancing the reliability and exploration capabilities of scientific surrogate models."
When Refreshable Tactile Displays Meet Conversational Agents: Investigating Accessible Data Presentation and Analysis with Touch and Speech,2024,Vis,0.0,['agents'],"Despite the recent surge of research efforts to make data visualizations accessible to people who are blind or have low vision (BLV), how to support BLV people's data analysis remains an important and challenging question. As refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) become cheaper and conversational agents continue to improve, their combination provides a promising approach to support BLV people's interactive data exploration and analysis. To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants, where they interacted with line charts, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. Our analysis of participants' interactions led to the identification of nine distinct patterns. We also learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics, and that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality. In addition, participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated a deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation. Our findings will inform the design of interfaces for such interactive mixed-modality systems."
DracoGPT: Extracting Visualization Design Preferences from Large Language Models,2024,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"Trained on vast corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to encode visualization design knowledge and best practices. However, if they fail to do so, they might provide unreliable visualization recommendations. What visualization design preferences, then, have LLMs learned? We contribute DracoGPT, a method for extracting, modeling, and assessing visualization design preferences from LLMs. To assess varied tasks, we develop two pipelines—DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend—to model LLMs prompted to either rank or recommend visual encoding specifications. We use Draco as a shared knowledge base in which to represent LLM design preferences and compare them to best practices from empirical research. We demonstrate that DracoGPT can accurately model the preferences expressed by LLMs, enabling analysis in terms of Draco design constraints. Across a suite of backing LLMs, we find that DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend moderately agree with each other, but both substantially diverge from guidelines drawn from human subjects experiments. Future work can build on our approach to expand Draco's knowledge base to model a richer set of preferences and to provide a robust and cost-effective stand-in for LLMs."
D-Tour: Semi-Automatic Generation of Interactive Guided Tours for Visualization Dashboard Onboarding,2024,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"Onboarding a user to a visualization dashboard entails explaining its various components, including the chart types used, the data loaded, and the interactions available. Authoring such an onboarding experience is time-consuming and requires significant knowledge and little guidance on how best to complete this task. Depending on their levels of expertise, end users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and overwhelmed or disinterested and disengaged. We propose interactive dashboard tours (D-Tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences that preserve the agency of users with various levels of expertise to keep them interested and engaged. Our interactive tours concept draws from open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path through onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR Prototype, which allows authors to craft custom interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g., video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an onboarding experience tailored to an individual user. We demonstrate the usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert interviews. Our evaluation shows that authors found the automation in the D-Tour Prototype helpful and time-saving, and users found the created tours engaging and intuitive.

StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization,2024,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"In volume visualization, visualization synthesis has attracted much attention due to its ability to generate novel visualizations without following the conventional rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions."
VADIS: A Visual Analytics Pipeline for Dynamic Document Representation and Information-Seeking,2024,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"In the biomedical domain, visualizing the document embeddings of an extensive corpus has been widely used in information-seeking tasks. However, three key challenges with existing visualizations make it difficult for clinicians to find information efficiently. First, the document embeddings used in these visualizations are generated statically by pretrained language models, which cannot adapt to the user's evolving interest. Second, existing document visualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are relevant to users' interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most pertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization processes suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand, trust and use the result for decision-making. In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics pipeline for user-driven document representation and iterative information seeking (VADIS). VADIS introduces a prompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding and document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize these two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a circular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the query and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the interpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to improve the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to identify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to refine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and iterative information-seeking experience. We evaluated VADIS quantitatively and qualitatively on a real-world dataset of biomedical research papers to demonstrate its effectiveness."
UnDRground Tubes: Exploring Spatial Data with Multidimensional Projections and Set Visualization,2024,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"In various scientific and industrial domains, analyzing multivariate spatial data, i.e., vectors associated with spatial locations, is common practice. To analyze those datasets, analysts may turn to methods such as Spatial Blind Source Separation (SBSS). Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, SBSS finds latent components in the dataset and is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, when analysts try different tuning parameter settings, the amount of latent components complicates analytical tasks. Based on our years-long collaboration with SBSS researchers, we propose a visualization approach to tackle this challenge. The main component is UnDRground Tubes (UT), a general-purpose idiom combining ideas from set visualization and multidimensional projections. We describe the UT visualization pipeline and integrate UT into an interactive multiple-view system. We demonstrate its effectiveness through interviews with SBSS experts, a qualitative evaluation with visualization experts, and computational experiments. SBSS experts were excited about our approach. They saw many benefits for their work and potential applications for geostatistical data analysis more generally. UT was also well received by visualization experts. Our benchmarks show that UT projections and its heuristics are appropriate."
Promises and Pitfalls: Using Large Language Models to Generate Visualization Items,2024,Vis,0.0,"['generation', 'pipeline automation']","Visualization items—factual questions about visualizations that ask viewers to accomplish visualization tasks-are regularly used in the field of information visualization as educational and evaluative materials. For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMS) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people's ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is the VILA bank of ~1, 100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of the VILA pipeline, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people's ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; comparing it to the existing VLAT, VILA-VLAT shows moderate to high convergent validity (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use. All supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/ysrhq/."
Smartboard: Visual Exploration of Team Tactics with LLM Agent,2024,Vis,0.0,['agents'],"Tactics play an important role in team sports by guiding how players interact on the field. Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches require users to experience a complex reasoning process to connect the multiple interactions within each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis, especially for play design. Smartboard provides users with a structured process of setup, simulation, and evolution, allowing for iterative exploration of tactics based on specific personalized scenarios. We conduct case studies based on real-world basketball datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our system."
Trust Your Gut: Comparing Human and Machine Inference from Noisy Visualizations,2024,Vis,0.0,['agents'],"People commonly utilize visualizations not only to examine a given dataset, but also to draw generalizable conclusions about the underlying models or phenomena. Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.

SpeechMirror: A Multimodal Visual Analytics System for Personalized Reflection of Online Public Speaking Effectiveness,2023,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"As communications are increasingly taking place virtually, the ability to present well online is becoming an indispensable skill. Online speakers are facing unique challenges in engaging with remote audiences. However, there has been a lack of evidence-based analytical systems for people to comprehensively evaluate online speeches and further discover possibilities for improvement. This paper introduces SpeechMirror, a visual analytics system facilitating reflection on a speech based on insights from a collection of online speeches. The system estimates the impact of different speech techniques on effectiveness and applies them to a speech to give users awareness of the performance of speech techniques. A similarity recommendation approach based on speech factors or script content supports guided exploration to expand knowledge of presentation evidence and accelerate the discovery of speech delivery possibilities. SpeechMirror provides intuitive visualizations and interactions for users to understand speech factors. Among them, SpeechTwin, a novel multimodal visual summary of speech, supports rapid understanding of critical speech factors and comparison of different speech samples, and SpeechPlayer augments the speech video by integrating visualization of the speaker's body language with interaction, for focused analysis. The system utilizes visualizations suited to the distinct nature of different speech factors for user comprehension. The proposed system and visualization techniques were evaluated with domain experts and amateurs, demonstrating usability for users with low visualization literacy and its efficacy in assisting users to develop insights for potential improvement."
Visual Analytics for Understanding Draco's Knowledge Base,2023,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"Draco has been developed as an automated visualization recommendation system formalizing design knowledge as logical constraints in ASP (Answer-Set Programming). With an increasing set of constraints and incorporated design knowledge, even visualization experts lose overview in Draco and struggle to retrace the automated recommendation decisions made by the system. Our paper proposes an Visual Analytics (VA) approach to visualize and analyze Draco's constraints. Our VA approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to accomplish identified tasks regarding the knowledge base and support them in better understanding Draco. We extend the existing data extraction strategy of Draco with a data processing architecture capable of extracting features of interest from the knowledge base. A revised version of the ASP grammar provides the basis for this data processing strategy. The resulting incorporated and shared features of the constraints are then visualized using a hypergraph structure inside the radial-arranged constraints of the elaborated visualization. The hierarchical categories of the constraints are indicated by arcs surrounding the constraints. Our approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to interactively explore the design rules' violations based on highlighting respective constraints or recommendations. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the prototype confirms the prototype's effectiveness and value in acquiring insights into Draco's recommendation process and design constraints."
"The Arrangement of Marks Impacts Afforded Messages: Ordering, Partitioning, Spacing, and Coloring in Bar Charts",2023,Vis,0.0,['recommendation'],"Data visualizations present a massive number of potential messages to an observer. One might notice that one group's average is larger than another's, or that a difference in values is smaller than a difference between two others, or any of a combinatorial explosion of other possibilities. The message that a viewer tends to notice – the message that a visualization ‘affords’ – is strongly affected by how values are arranged in a chart, e.g., how the values are colored or positioned. Although understanding the mapping between a chart's arrangement and what viewers tend to notice is critical for creating guidelines and recommendation systems, current empirical work is insufficient to lay out clear rules. We present a set of empirical evaluations of how different messages-including ranking, grouping, and part-to-whole relationships–are afforded by variations in ordering, partitioning, spacing, and coloring of values, within the ubiquitous case study of bar graphs. In doing so, we introduce a quantitative method that is easily scalable, reviewable, and replicable, laying groundwork for further investigation of the effects of arrangement on message affordances across other visualizations and tasks. Pre-registration and all supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/np3q7 and https://osf.io/bvy95, respectively."
Data Formulator: AI-Powered Concept-Driven Visualization Authoring,2023,Vis,0.0,['agents'],"With most modern visualization tools, authors need to transform their data into tidy formats to create visualizations they want. Because this requires experience with programming or separate data processing tools, data transformation remains a barrier in visualization authoring. To address this challenge, we present a new visualization paradigm, concept binding, that separates high-level visualization intents and low-level data transformation steps, leveraging an AI agent. We realize this paradigm in Data Formulator, an interactive visualization authoring tool. With Data Formulator, authors first define data concepts they plan to visualize using natural languages or examples, and then bind them to visual channels. Data Formulator then dispatches its AI-agent to automatically transform the input data to surface these concepts and generate desired visualizations. When presenting the results (transformed table and output visualizations) from the AI agent, Data Formulator provides feedback to help authors inspect and understand them. A user study with 10 participants shows that participants could learn and use Data Formulator to create visualizations that involve challenging data transformations, and presents interesting future research directions."
Guided Visual Analytics for Image Selection in Time and Space,2023,Vis,0.0,['mixed-initiative'],"Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) detection, the identification of remnant active bombs buried underground from archival aerial images, implies a complex workflow involving decision-making at each stage. An essential phase in UXO detection is the task of image selection, where a small subset of images must be chosen from archives to reconstruct an area of interest (AOI) and identify craters. The selected image set must comply with good spatial and temporal coverage over the AOI, particularly in the temporal vicinity of recorded aerial attacks, and do so with minimal images for resource optimization. This paper presents a guidance-enhanced visual analytics prototype to select images for UXO detection. In close collaboration with domain experts, our design process involved analyzing user tasks, eliciting expert knowledge, modeling quality metrics, and choosing appropriate guidance. We report on a user study with two real-world scenarios of image selection performed with and without guidance. Our solution was well-received and deemed highly usable. Through the lens of our task-based design and developed quality measures, we observed guidance-driven changes in user behavior and improved quality of analysis results. An expert evaluation of the study allowed us to improve our guidance-enhanced prototype further and discuss new possibilities for user-adaptive guidance."
A Parallel Framework for Streaming Dimensionality Reduction,2023,Vis,0.0,['pipeline automation'],"The visualization of streaming high-dimensional data often needs to consider the speed in dimensionality reduction algorithms, the quality of visualized data patterns, and the stability of view graphs that usually change over time with new data. Existing methods of streaming high-dimensional data visualization primarily line up essential modules in a serial manner and often face challenges in satisfying all these design considerations. In this research, we propose a novel parallel framework for streaming high-dimensional data visualization to achieve high data processing speed, high quality in data patterns, and good stability in visual presentations. This framework arranges all essential modules in parallel to mitigate the delays caused by module waiting in serial setups. In addition, to facilitate the parallel pipeline, we redesign these modules with a parametric non-linear embedding method for new data embedding, an incremental learning method for online embedding function updating, and a hybrid strategy for optimized embedding updating. We also improve the coordination mechanism among these modules. Our experiments show that our method has advantages in embedding speed, quality, and stability over other existing methods to visualize streaming high-dimensional data."
