Include a single visual: a one-row sparkline timeline and three bullet metrics (peak year, share of Vis papers, top-cited AutoVis paper)."

Also list derived metrics (normalized citation per year, relative downloads) and planned visual forms. This section ensures reproducibility and lets readers judge the identification approach."
