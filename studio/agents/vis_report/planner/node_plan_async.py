    You are an expert in data analysis and visualization.
    You are preparing a visualization report based on analysis of the vis publication dataset.

    You have created an outline of the report and now you are working on a specific section.
    You need to design the analysis to perform for completing the section.

    Please follow the steps below to design the analysis:
    1. Decide whether to perform analysis and how many analysess
        1.1 if you decide not to perform analysis, return an empty list
        1.2 if you decide to perform analysis, continue to the next step
    2. For each analysis
        2.1. Decide the action (present or explore)
        2.2. Specify the information need based on the action you choose

    ### Instruction for deciding the number of analyses ###

    - 0 (pending analysis): you may choose pending the analysis if you can reuse the results from the other sections.
        - for example, if the section is an introduction, executive summary, synthesis, or conclusion
        - especially for the first and last sections
        - Return an empty list if you choose this
    - Otherwise, you can choose from 1 to {config["max_analyses_per_section"]} analyses, depending on the complexity of the section.
        - Each analysis should be focused on a specific question.


     ### Instructions for the action ###

    You can choose between three types of actions:
    1. Present: Generate visualisation and corresponding insights
        - If you are confident about which visualisation to use and that you can generate the vega-lite specification without further exploration, you can choose this action.
        - You don't need to know what the insights are, you will be able to analyse and generate the insights.
        - The question is whether you are confident about the visualisation to use.
    2. Explore: Plan for exploratory analysis
        - If you are not sure about the content of the section, you can choose this action.
        - You need to specify the information need (what you expect through the exploration and analysis)

    ### Instructions for the information need ###

    Specify the information need if you choose 'present' or 'explore'.
    - For 'present', basically you need to structure how you plan to design the visualisation.
        - It is a high level plan (such as the important attributes), you don't need to work on the visual design.
        - You can decide how many visualisations, but usually no more than 2.
        - There is no need to fully fulfil the planned description, you can do a trade-off and focus on the most important parts.
        - Note the visualisation will be generated by vega-lite, so it can not be too complex.
    - For 'explore', you need to specify the information need (what you expect through the exploration and analysis)
        - You can specify multiple information needs, but usually no more than 3.
        - You are encouraged to re-formulate the need as you perform the exploration. Therefore, you can start with simple need if you are not very sure.
        - Example situations that need exploration:
            - You are not sure about which filter or transformation to apply to the data.
            - Certain attributes need to be derived from the data (which can not be easily derived through vega-lite).
            - When you decide to present subset or examples but you are not sure about which subset or examples to use.
            - Others...
        - Similarly, focus on the most important parts.

    Form the information need for 'present' as follows:
    - question_text: the question you want to answer through the exploration and analysis. The question should be focused (just one specifc point).
    - primary_attributes: the primary attributes to use for visual encoding (visual channels), usually no more than 2.
    - secondary_attributes: the secondary attributes to use for visual encoding, usually no more than 2.
    - transformation: the transformation to apply to the data, can be none, usually no more than 3.
    - expected_insight_types: the expected insight types from the analysis, such as top, trend, distribution, outlier, etc.
    - parameters: the parameters for the analysis, such as the number of top items, the threshold for the trend, the threshold for the distribution, the threshold for the outlier, etc.

    Form the information need for 'explore' as follows:
    - question_text: the question you want to answer through the exploration and analysis. The question should be focused (just one specifc point).
    - key_uncertainty: if you choose 'explore', specify the key uncertainty you have about the data, which reflects the main goal of the exploration.
    - expected_outputs: the expected outputs from the exploration to resolve uncertainty.
        - Should be practical, such as parameter values for filtering, transformation; or important insights that help you decide the next step.
        - Consider the limit of tools that you can use: you may use pandas and simple networkx, but time-consuming tasks or machine learning tasks are not recommended.
        - Usually no more than 3.

    Please make the information need as simple and focused as possible.
