                        1. Citation counts peaked at 67.24 in 2013, marking a 256.4% increase from the start of the period.
2. After 2013, citation counts plummeted by 99.9%, reaching a minimum of 0.06 in 2024.
3. The overall citation trend from 1990 to 2024 shows a dramatic decline of 99.7%.

                        - **Field Evolution and Maturity:**
  - The citation trend indicates that the field experienced significant growth and interest, peaking in 2013. This suggests that during this period, the field was likely at the forefront of innovation and research activity, attracting substantial attention from the academic community.
  - The subsequent decline in citations suggests that the field may have reached a level of maturity where foundational concepts have been established, and the pace of groundbreaking discoveries has slowed. This could imply that the field is transitioning from a growth phase to a more stable, mature phase.

- **Research Community's Attention Patterns:**
  - The sharp increase in citations leading up to 2013 reflects a period of intense research activity and interest, possibly driven by new methodologies, technologies, or applications that captured the community's focus.
  - The dramatic decline post-2013 indicates a shift in the research community's attention, possibly due to the emergence of new fields or technologies that have diverted interest away from this area. It may also suggest that the field's key questions have been largely addressed, leading to reduced novelty in subsequent research.

- **Implications for Researchers:**
  - For researchers currently in the field, the decline in citations could mean that there is a need to innovate or pivot towards emerging subfields or interdisciplinary approaches to maintain relevance and impact.
  - New entrants to the field should be aware that while foundational knowledge is well-established, opportunities may lie in niche areas or in applying existing knowledge to new problems or industries.
  - The data suggests that researchers should focus on identifying gaps or unexplored areas within the field that could reignite interest and lead to new waves of citation and recognition.
