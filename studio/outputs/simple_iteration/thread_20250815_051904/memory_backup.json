In 2012, the research further evolved to explore semantic interaction for sensemaking, focusing on user interaction and the integration of analytical reasoning with model steering. This indicates a trend towards more sophisticated and user-centered approaches in sensemaking research over the years."

In 2010, the focus was on using social media for journalistic inquiry, with an emphasis on computational journalism and social media as tools for sensemaking. User interaction was primarily about extracting news value from large-scale social media content. By 2011, the research shifted towards interaction with statistical models, highlighting observation-level interactions that allow users to express their reasoning on data points rather than just adjusting model parameters. This indicates a move towards more interactive and user-driven approaches. In 2012, the focus further evolved to explore semantic interaction, which integrates user interaction with analytical reasoning and model steering, suggesting a trend towards more sophisticated and user-centered methodologies in sensemaking research.",
