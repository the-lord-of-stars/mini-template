InfoVis,2015,How do People Make Sense of Unfamiliar Visualizations?: A Grounded Model of Novice's Information Visualization Sensemaking,10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467195,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467195,499.0,508.0,J,"In this paper, we would like to investigate how people make sense of unfamiliar information visualizations. In order to achieve the research goal, we conducted a qualitative study by observing 13 participants when they endeavored to make sense of three unfamiliar visualizations (i.e., a parallel-coordinates plot, a chord diagram, and a treemap) that they encountered for the first time. We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information VIsualization Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame, 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame, and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.",Sukwon Lee;Sung-Hee Kim;Ya-Hsin Hung;Heidi Lam;Youn-Ah Kang;Ji Soo Yi,Sukwon Lee;Sung-Hee Kim;Ya-Hsin Hung;Heidi Lam;Youn-Ah Kang;Ji Soo Yi,"School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA;Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA;Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA;Techno-Art Division, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea;School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA",10.1109/tvcg.2013.234;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346984;10.1109/tvcg.2010.164;10.1109/vast.2011.6102435;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452;10.1109/tvcg.2010.177;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346481;10.1109/tvcg.2010.179;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70515;10.1109/tvcg.2013.234,"Sensemaking model, information visualization, novice users, grounded theory, qualitative study",147.0,91.0,48.0,4623.0,,
VAST,2016,Annotation Graphs: A Graph-Based Visualization for Meta-Analysis of Data Based on User-Authored Annotations,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598543,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598543,261.0,270.0,J,"User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas.",Jian Zhao 0010;Michael Glueck;Simon Breslav;Fanny Chevalier;Azam Khan,Jian Zhao;Michael Glueck;Simon Breslav;Fanny Chevalier;Azam Khan,Autodesk Research;Autodesk Research;Autodesk Research;INRIA;Autodesk Research,10.1109/vast.2009.5333878;10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467871;10.1109/vast.2009.5333023;10.1109/vast.2011.6102447;10.1109/tvcg.2008.137;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346573;10.1109/vast.2008.4677365;10.1109/tvcg.2013.124;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577;10.1109/vast.2010.5652879;10.1109/vast.2009.5333878,Externalization user-authored annotation;exploratory sequential data analysis;graph-based visualization,39.0,33.0,39.0,2188.0,,
VAST,2014,A Five-Level Design Framework for Bicluster Visualizations,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346665,1713.0,1722.0,J,"Analysts often need to explore and identify coordinated relationships (e.g., four people who visited the same five cities on the same set of days) within some large datasets for sensemaking. Biclusters provide a potential solution to ease this process, because each computed bicluster bundles individual relationships into coordinated sets. By understanding such computed, structural, relations within biclusters, analysts can leverage their domain knowledge and intuition to determine the importance and relevance of the extracted relationships for making hypotheses. However, due to the lack of systematic design guidelines, it is still a challenge to design effective and usable visualizations of biclusters to enhance their perceptibility and interactivity for exploring coordinated relationships. In this paper, we present a five-level design framework for bicluster visualizations, with a survey of the state-of-the-art design considerations and applications that are related or that can be applied to bicluster visualizations. We summarize pros and cons of these design options to support user tasks at each of the five-level relationships. Finally, we discuss future research challenges for bicluster visualizations and their incorporation into visual analytics tools.",Maoyuan Sun;Chris North 0001;Naren Ramakrishnan,Maoyuan Sun;Chris North;Naren Ramakrishnan,"Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech;Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech;Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech",10.1109/tvcg.2006.147;10.1109/tvcg.2009.153;10.1109/infvis.2005.1532126;10.1109/tvcg.2010.138;10.1109/visual.1990.146402;10.1109/tvcg.2011.250;10.1109/tvcg.2006.160;10.1109/tvcg.2009.122;10.1109/visual.1999.809866;10.1109/vast.2006.261426;10.1109/infvis.2004.1;10.1109/vast.2011.6102449;10.1109/tvcg.2013.167;10.1109/tvcg.2006.170;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70582;10.1109/tvcg.2011.185;10.1109/tvcg.2006.147,"Biclusters, interactive visual analytics, coordinated relationships, design framework",35.0,27.0,93.0,755.0,,

We extend and apply a cognitive model called ""visual sensemaking"" to the visualization spreadsheet. We use the task of making sense of a large Web site as a concrete example throughout the paper for demonstration. Using a variety of visualization techniques, such as the Disk Tree and Cone Tree, we show that the interactions of the visualization spreadsheet help users draw conclusions from the overall relationships of the entire information set.",Ed Huai-hsin Chi;Stuart K.

VAST,2010,NetClinic: Interactive visualization to enhance automated fault diagnosis in enterprise networks,10.1109/vast.2010.5652910,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652910,131.0,138.0,C,"Diagnosing faults in an operational computer network is a frustrating, time-consuming exercise. Despite advances, automatic diagnostic tools are far from perfect: they occasionally miss the true culprit and are mostly only good at narrowing down the search to a few potential culprits. This uncertainty and the inability to extract useful sense from tool output renders most tools not usable to administrators. To bridge this gap, we present NetClinic, a visual analytics system that couples interactive visualization with an automated diagnostic tool for enterprise networks. It enables administrators to verify the output of the automatic analysis at different levels of detail and to move seamlessly across levels while retaining appropriate context. A qualitative user study shows that NetClinic users can accurately identify the culprit, even when it is not present in the suggestions made by the automated component. We also find that supporting a variety of sensemaking strategies is a key to the success of systems that enhance automated diagnosis.",Zhicheng Liu 0001;Bongshin Lee;Srikanth Kandula;Ratul Mahajan,Zhicheng Liu;Bongshin Lee;Srikanth Kandula;Ratul Mahajan,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Microsoft Research Limited, USA;Microsoft Research Limited, USA;Microsoft Research Limited, USA;Microsoft Research Limited, USA",10.1109/tvcg.2006.122;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70522;10.1109/vast.2009.5333878;10.1109/vast.2007.4389006;10.1109/vast.2006.261429;10.1109/tvcg.2006.122,"Sensemaking, Semantic Graph Layout, Visual Analytics, Network Diagnosis, Information Visualization",26.0,13.0,28.0,320.0,,
VAST,2012,SocialNetSense: Supporting sensemaking of social and structural features in networks with interactive visualization,10.1109/vast.2012.6400558,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2012.6400558,133.0,142.0,C,"Increasingly, social network datasets contain social attribute information about actors and their relationship. Analyzing such network with social attributes requires making sense of not only its structural features, but also the relationship between social features in attributes and network structures. Existing social network analysis tools are usually weak in supporting complex analytical tasks involving both structural and social features, and often overlook users' needs for sensemaking tools that help to gather, synthesize, and organize information of these features. To address these challenges, we propose a sensemaking framework of social-network visual analytics in this paper. This framework considers both bottom-up processes, which are about constructing new understandings based on collected information, and top-down processes, which concern using prior knowledge to guide information collection, in analyzing social networks from both social and structural perspectives. The framework also emphasizes the externalization of sensemaking processes through interactive visualization. Guided by the framework, we develop a system, SocialNetSense, to support the sensemaking in visual analytics of social networks with social attributes. The example of using our system to analyze a scholar collaboration network shows that our approach can help users gain insight into social networks both structurally and socially, and enhance their process awareness in visual analytics.",Liang Gou;Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang;Airong Luo;Patricia F.

Vis,2023,Visualization According to Statisticians: An Interview Study on the Role of Visualization for Inferential Statistics,10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326521,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326521,230.0,239.0,J,"Statisticians are not only one of the earliest professional adopters of data visualization, but also some of its most prolific users. Understanding how these professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process may shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results from an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years average in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in their daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical processes; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent statistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential statistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and finally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving thematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit. The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous thinking. The latter suggests that a multi-faceted visual display of inferential statistics that includes a visual indicator of analytically important effect sizes may help to balance the attributed epistemic power of traditional statistical testing with an awareness of the uncertainty of sensemaking.",Eric Newburger;Niklas Elmqvist,Eric Newburger;Niklas Elmqvist,"U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD, USA;Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark",0.1109/tvcg.2021.3114830;10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598862;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346298;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864907;10.1109/tvcg.2013.183;10.1109/tvcg.2010.164;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346292;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70541;10.1109/tvcg.2010.161,"Inferential statistics,qualitative interview study,thematic coding,statistical visualization",,0.0,32.0,535.0,,
