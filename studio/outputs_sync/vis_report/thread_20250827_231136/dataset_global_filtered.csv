InfoVis,1995,Towards a generative theory of diagram design,10.1109/infvis.1995.528681,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528681,11.0,18.0,C,"We describe the theoretical background for AVE, an automatic visualization engine for semantic networks. We have a functional notion of aesthetics and therefore understand meaningfulness as a central issue for information visualization. This implies that the diagrams should communicate the characteristics of the data as effectively as possible. In this generative theory of diagram design, we include data characterization, systematic use of graphical means of expression and the combination of graphical means of expression. After giving a brief introduction and an application scenario we discuss these aspects in detail. Finally, a process model of an automatic visualization process is sketched and directions for further research are outlined.",Klaus Reichenberger;Thomas Kamps;Gene Golovchinsky,K. Reichenberger;T.

We have implemented a prototype called AVE (Automatic Visualization Environment) that generates diagrams automatically based on a generative theory of diagram design. According to this theory, diagrams are constructed based on the data to be visualized rather than by selection from a predefined set of diagrams. This approach can be applied to knowledge represented by semantic networks. We give a brief introduction to the underlying theory, then describe the implementation and finally discuss strategies for extending the algorithm.",Gene Golovchinsky;Klaus Reichenberger;Thomas Kamps,G.

Vis,2004,Non-linear model fitting to parameterize diseased blood vessels,10.1109/visual.2004.72,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2004.72,393.0,400.0,C,"Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of healthy and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.",Alexandra La Cruz;Matús Straka;Arnold Köchl;Milos Srámek;M. Eduard Gröller;Dominik Fleischmann,A. La Cruz;M.

Vis,2007,Interactive Visual Analysis of Perfusion Data,10.1109/tvcg.2007.70569,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70569,1392.0,1399.0,J,"Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.",Steffen Oeltze;Helmut Doleisch;Helwig Hauser;Philipp Muigg;Bernhard Preim,Steffen Oeltze;Helmut Doleisch;Helwig Hauser;Philipp Muigg;Bernhard Preim,"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany",10.1109/visual.2000.885739;10.1109/visual.2005.1532847;10.1109/visual.2000.885739,"Multi-field Visualization, Visual Data Mining, Time-varying Volume Data, Integrating InfoVis/SciVis",100.0,44.0,28.0,666.0,,

When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.",Thomas Butkiewicz;Wenwen Dou;Zachary Wartell;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,Thomas Butkiewicz;Wenwen Dou;Zachary Wartell;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,"UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center;UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center;UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center;UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center;UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center",10.1109/infvis.2000.885102;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70574;10.1109/infvis.2000.885102,"Multiple-view techniques, geospatial visualization, geospatial analysis, focus + context, probes",73.0,34.0,20.0,648.0,,

As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view.

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell.

The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimization-based method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration.",Gunnar Läthén;Stefan Lindholm;Reiner Lenz;Anders Persson;Magnus Borga,Gunnar Läthén;Stefan Lindholm;Reiner Lenz;Anders Persson;Magnus Borga,"Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden;Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden;Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden;Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Sweden;Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Department of Biomedical Engineering, Linköping University, Sweden",10.1109/visual.2003.1250414;10.1109/tvcg.2009.120;10.1109/visual.2001.964516;10.1109/visual.1996.568113;10.1109/tvcg.2008.162;10.1109/tvcg.2010.195;10.1109/tvcg.2008.123,"Direct volume rendering, transfer functions, vessel visualization",29.0,14.0,34.0,513.0,,

Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions.

However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time.

They consist of sequences of amino acids. An interaction with reactive agent can stimulate a mutation at a specific position in the sequence. This mutation may set off a chain reaction, which effects other amino acids in the protein. Chain reactions need to be analyzed, as they may invoke unwanted side effects in drug treatment. A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose. We present a new system for the search and the exploration of frequent patterns (i.e., motifs) in mutation graphs. We present a fast pattern search algorithm specifically developed for finding biologically relevant patterns in many mutation graphs (i.e., many labeled acyclic directed graphs).

The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.",Miguel Nunes;Benjamin Rowland;Matthias Schlachter;Soléakhéna Ken;Kresimir Matkovic;Anne Laprie;Katja Bühler,Miguel Nunes;Benjamin Rowland;Matthias Schlachter;Soléakhéna Ken;Kresimir Matkovic;Anne Laprie;Katja Bühler,"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria",10.1109/tvcg.2007.70569;10.1109/tvcg.2013.180;10.1109/tvcg.2010.176;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70569,"MR spectroscopy, cancer, brain, visualization, multi-modality data, radiotherapy planning, medical decision support systems",17.0,5.0,29.0,300.0,,

Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace.

Second, these environments often assume a single-developer perspective, while data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control systems provide.

In this paper, we present Data-Driven Guides (DDG), a technique for designing expressive information graphics in a graphic design environment. Instead of being confined by predefined templates or marks, designers can generate guides from data and use the guides to draw, place and measure custom shapes. We provide guides to encode data using three fundamental visual encoding channels: length, area, and position. Users can combine more than one guide to construct complex visual structures and map these structures to data. When underlying data is changed, we use a deformation technique to transform custom shapes using the guides as the backbone of the shapes. Our evaluation shows that data-driven guides allow users to create expressive and more accurate custom data-driven graphics.",Nam Wook Kim;Eston Schweickart;Zhicheng Liu 0001;Mira Dontcheva;Wilmot Li;Jovan Popovic;Hanspeter Pfister,Nam Wook Kim;Eston Schweickart;Zhicheng Liu;Mira Dontcheva;Wilmot Li;Jovan Popovic;Hanspeter Pfister,"John A.

Visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? To address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. We propose a trust-augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. For evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. We find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. In fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums.

At the same time, advanced visual analytic systems have made increasing use of human-machine collaboration to solve problems not tractable by machine computation alone. To continue to make progress in modeling user tasks in these hybrid visual analytic systems, we must strive to gain insight into what makes certain tasks more complex than others. This will require the development of mechanisms for describing the balance to be struck between machine and human strengths with respect to analytical tasks and workload.

Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user's data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user's subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings.

Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with additional constraints or updated weights.

NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools. Participant feedback suggested that interactive data facts aided them in interpreting visualizations. Participants also stated that the suggestions surfaced through the facts helped them explore alternative visualizations and embellishments to communicate individual data facts.",Arjun Srinivasan;Steven Mark Drucker;Alex Endert;John T.

Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.",Chunyao Qian;Shizhao Sun;Weiwei Cui;Jian-Guang Lou;Haidong Zhang;Dongmei Zhang 0001,Chunyao Qian;Shizhao Sun;Weiwei Cui;Jian-Guang Lou;Haidong Zhang;Dongmei Zhang,"Microsoft Research Asia, Peking University;Microsoft Research Asia;Microsoft Research Asia;Microsoft Research Asia;Microsoft Research Asia;Microsoft Research Asia",10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934810;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934785;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934431;10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598620;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934810,"Infographics,automatic visualization",20.0,31.0,38.0,1004.0,,

Systems such as Tableau have started to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information. Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from these visualization specifications and how various natural language processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as one way to measure relevance.

Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge.

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews.

However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences.

To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner. We compare our deep learning model with existing methods for visualization recommendation and conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the system.",Aoyu Wu;Yun Wang 0012;Mengyu Zhou;Xinyi He;Haidong Zhang;Huamin Qu;Dongmei Zhang 0001,Aoyu Wu;Yun Wang;Mengyu Zhou;Xinyi He;Haidong Zhang;Huamin Qu;Dongmei Zhang,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong and Microsoft Research Area, United States;Microsoft Research Area, United States;Microsoft Research Area, United States;Microsoft Research Area, United States;Microsoft Research Area, United States;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong;Microsoft Research Area, United States",10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030338;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934810;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865138;10.1109/tvcg.2013.119;10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598620;10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744019;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865235;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030430;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030387;10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198;10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346291;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865158;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864903;10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030403;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030396;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865145;10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744843;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934798;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934398;10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030423,"Visualization Recommendation,Deep Learning,Multiple-View,Dashboard,Mixed-Initiative,Visualization Provenance",14.0,31.0,73.0,1788.0,,

Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an <i>evaluation</i> perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.",Zehua Zeng;Phoebe Moh;Fan Du;Jane Hoffswell;Tak Yeon Lee;Sana Malik;Eunyee Koh;Leilani Battle,Zehua Zeng;Phoebe Moh;Fan Du;Jane Hoffswell;Tak Yeon Lee;Sana Malik;Eunyee Koh;Leilani Battle,"University of Maryland, United States;University of Maryland, United States;Adobe Research, United States;Adobe Research, United States;Adobe Research, United States and KAIST, South Korea;Adobe Research, United States;Adobe Research, United States;University of Maryland, United States and University of Washington, United States",10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136;10.1109/tvcg.2008.137;10.1109/tvcg.2012.219;10.1109/visual.1999.809871;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934398;10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191,"Visualization Tools,Visualization Recommendation Algorithms",13.0,25.0,38.0,1106.0,HM,

Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance.

We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution.

With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles.

We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts.

However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations.

A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is “aligned” with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations.

However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences.

To create a dashboard, users have to configure charts by selecting data columns and exploring different chart combinations to optimize the communication of insights, which is trial-and-error. Recent research has started to use deep learning methods for dashboard generation to lower the burden of visualization creation. However, such efforts are greatly hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets of dashboards. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use well-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of reinforcement learning.

This approach prevents them from making effective visualization choices for the many combinations of data types and analysis questions they encounter in their work. Visualization recommendation systems assist non-experts in creating data visualization by recommending appropriate visualizations based on the data and task characteristics.

While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests. In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items. Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts. Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of InkSight in expressing user intent and facilitating chart finding documentation.",Yanna Lin;Haotian Li 0001;Leni Yang;Aoyu Wu;Huamin Qu,Yanna Lin;Haotian Li;Leni Yang;Aoyu Wu;Huamin Qu,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Harvard University, USA;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China",0.1109/tvcg.2019.2934785;10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114802;10.1109/tvcg.2013.191;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030378;10.1109/tvcg.2022.3209421;10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030403;10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865145;10.1109/tvcg.2012.275;10.1109/tvcg.2022.3209357;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934398;10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114826;10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114774;10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934668,"Computational Notebook,Sketch-based Interaction,Documentation,Visualization,Exploratory Data Analysis",,5.0,58.0,665.0,,

However, existing deconstruction approaches primarily focus on chart styles, handling only basic layouts. In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones, as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets.

First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data.

The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network.

However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements for text summarization through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the effectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation of summarization prompts, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks.

This paper introduces KnowNet a visualization system that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KG) to provide enhanced accuracy and structured exploration. Specifically, for enhanced accuracy, KnowNet extracts triples (e.g., entities and their relations) from LLM outputs and maps them into the validated information and supported evidence in external KGs. For structured exploration, KnowNet provides next-step recommendations based on the neighborhood of the currently explored entities in KGs, aiming to guide a comprehensive understanding without overlooking critical aspects. To enable reasoning with both the structured data in KGs and the unstructured outputs from LLMs, KnowNet conceptualizes the understanding of a subject as the gradual construction of graph visualization. A progressive graph visualization is introduced to monitor past inquiries, and bridge the current query with the exploration history and next-step recommendations.

Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability.

As refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) become cheaper and conversational agents continue to improve, their combination provides a promising approach to support BLV people's interactive data exploration and analysis. To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants, where they interacted with line charts, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. Our analysis of participants' interactions led to the identification of nine distinct patterns. We also learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics, and that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality. In addition, participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated a deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation.

We use Draco as a shared knowledge base in which to represent LLM design preferences and compare them to best practices from empirical research. We demonstrate that DracoGPT can accurately model the preferences expressed by LLMs, enabling analysis in terms of Draco design constraints. Across a suite of backing LLMs, we find that DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend moderately agree with each other, but both substantially diverge from guidelines drawn from human subjects experiments.

In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs.

Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.
