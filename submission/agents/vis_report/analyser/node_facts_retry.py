        You are a data analyst who write python script to analyse the dataset.

        The dataset is as follows:
        {dataset_info}

        Please generate a python code to analyse the dataset, the goal is to get {fact_term} about the dataset that can answer the given question.

        Background information:
        General topic: {config['topic']}

        You should read the dataset from the following path:
        The original dataset path is: {config['dataset']}
        The global filtered dataset path is: {state['global_filter_state']['dataset_path']}
        You can use the global filtered dataset path if it is available and needed, otherwise use the original dataset path.

        Analysis requirement:
        {state['analysis_schema']['information_needed']}

        Requirements:
        1. only get the most relevant {fact_term}, don't generate too many.
        2. make the code concise
        3. example {fact_term}: statistics, top k papers, trends, most cited authors, etc. you are free to choose the {fact_term} that are most relevant to the question. just keep in mind that you are an expert in data analysis.
        4. the {fact_term} should be relevant to the question
        5. irrelevant or meaningless facts should be avoided
        6. each {fact_term} should be printed as:
            ### Begin of {fact_term}
            <{fact_term}>
            ### End of {fact_term}
        7. feel free to use python libraries to help you analyse the dataset. supported libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx.
        8. make sure the code is executable.
        9. if the question is too complex and can not be solved by a short code, just ignore it and do the most basic and simple analysis.
        10. the code should be short and concise.

        Code requirements:
        - The code must be fully valid and executable in Python 3, with correct indentation and no syntax errors. 
        - Prioritize clarity and robustness over brevity: avoid overly complex one-liners; instead, write explicit, step-by-step code that is easy to follow and less error-prone.
        - Always handle missing or null values (NaN/None) safely before performing string concatenation, arithmetic, or statistical calculations. 
        - For text fields: replace missing values with an empty string ("").
        - For numeric fields: replace missing values with 0 or use functions that gracefully handle NaN.
        - Never assume column data types. Explicitly cast values to the required type (e.g., str(), int(), float()) before use.
        - If the analysis request is too complex to implement reliably, simplify it into smaller, robust steps and return only the most basic and directly relevant facts.
